            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <p>Seeing then the learning of Architecture comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in it many notable Artes, it is neceÅ¿Å¿ary that the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitector or workeman, Å¿hould firÅ¿t, or at the leaÅ¿t (if he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not attaine vnto any more) know Å¿o much thereof, as that hee may vnderÅ¿tand the principles of Geometrie, that he may not be accompted amongÅ¿t the number of Å¿tone-Å¿poilers, who beare the name of workmen, and Å¿carce know how to make an anÅ¿were what a Point, Line, Plaine, or Body is, and much leÅ¿Å¿e can tell what harmonie or correÅ¿pondencie meaneth, but following after their owne minde, or other blinde con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductors that haue vÅ¿ed to worke without rule or reaÅ¿on, they make bad worke, which is the cauÅ¿e of much vncut or vneuen workemanÅ¿hip which is found in many places.</p>

                           <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lthough the Å¿ubtill and ingenious Arte of PerÅ¿pectiue is very difficult and troubleÅ¿ome to Å¿et downe in writing, and Å¿pecially the body, or modell of things, which are drawen out of the ground: for it is an Arte which cannot be Å¿o well expreÅ¿Å¿ed by figures or writings, as by an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derÅ¿hewing, which is done Å¿euerally: NotwithÅ¿tanding, Å¿eeing that in my firÅ¿t Booke I haue Å¿poken of Geometry, without the which PerÅ¿pectiue Arte is nothing: I will labour in the brie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feÅ¿t manner that I can in this my Å¿econd Booke, to Å¿hewe the workeman Å¿o much thereof, that hee Å¿hall bee able to aide and helpe himÅ¿elfe therewith.</hi>

                        <hi>In this worke I will not trouble my Å¿elfe to diÅ¿pute PhiloÅ¿ophically what PerÅ¿pectiue is, or from whence it hath the originall: for learned <hi>Euclides</hi> writeth darkely of the Å¿peculation thereof.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But to proceede to the matter, touching that the workeman Å¿hall haue cauÅ¿e to vÅ¿e, you muÅ¿t vnderÅ¿tand, that PerÅ¿pectiue is that, which <hi>Vitruuius</hi> calleth Scenographie, that is, the vpright part and Å¿ides of any buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding or of any Superficies or bodies.</hi>

                        <hi>This PerÅ¿pectiue then, conÅ¿iÅ¿teth principally in three lines: The firÅ¿t line is the BaÅ¿e below, from whence all things haue their beginning. The Å¿econd line is that, which goeth or reacheth to the point, which Å¿ome call Å¿ight, others, the horiÅ¿on: But the horiÅ¿on is the right name thereof, for the horiÅ¿on is in euery place whereÅ¿oeuer Å¿ight endeth. The third line, is the line of the diÅ¿tances, which ought alwayes to Å¿tand Å¿o high as the horiÅ¿on is farre or neere, according to the Å¿ituation, as when time Å¿erueth, I will declare.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>This HoriÅ¿on is to be vnderÅ¿tood to Å¿tand at the corners of our Å¿ight, as if the workeman would Å¿hew a piece of worke againÅ¿t a flat wall, taking his beginning from the ground, where the feete of the beholders Å¿hould Å¿tand. In Å¿uch caÅ¿e it is requiÅ¿ite, that the HoriÅ¿on Å¿hould bee as high as our eye, and the diÅ¿tance to Å¿ee or behold that worke, Å¿hall be Å¿et or placed in the fitteÅ¿t place thereabouts, as if it were in a Hall, or a Chamber, then the diÅ¿tance Å¿hall be taken at the entry thereof: but if it bee within, or at the end of a Gallery or Court, then the diÅ¿tance Å¿hall be Å¿et at the entry of the Å¿ame place, and if it bee in a Streete againÅ¿t a wall or an houÅ¿e, then you muÅ¿t Å¿et your diÅ¿tance on the other Å¿ide, right ouer againÅ¿t it. But if in Å¿uch a caÅ¿e the Å¿treete is very narrow, then it were good to imagine a broad diÅ¿tance, leÅ¿t the Å¿hortening fall out to be ouer-tedious or vnpleaÅ¿ant vnto you: for the longer or the wyder the diÅ¿tance is, the worke will Å¿hew Å¿o much the better and pleaÅ¿anter.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But if you will begin a piece of worke of fiue or Å¿ixe foote high from the ground whereon you Å¿tand, then it is requiÅ¿ite that the HoriÅ¿on Å¿hould Å¿tand euen with your eyes (as I Å¿ayd before) but if a man Å¿hould Å¿ee no ground of the worke, whereon the vppermoÅ¿t part doeth Å¿tand (and a man would worke very high) it would not be correÅ¿pondent with the eyes: In Å¿uch a caÅ¿e a man muÅ¿t take vpon him to place the HoriÅ¿on Å¿omewhat higher, by the aduice of Å¿ome Å¿kilfull workman, which maketh hiÅ¿tories or other things vpon HouÅ¿es, thirtie or fortie foote high aboue a mans Å¿ight, which is vnfittingly. But cunning workmen fall into no Å¿uch errors; for where they haue made any thing aboue our Å¿ight, there you could Å¿ee no ground of the Å¿ame worke, for that the notable PerÅ¿pectiue Art hath bridled them: and therefore (as I Å¿ayd before) PerÅ¿pectiue Art is very neceÅ¿Å¿ary for a workeman: And no PerÅ¿pectiue workeman can make any worke without Architecture, nor the Architecture without PerÅ¿pectiue.</hi>

And as thoÅ¿e Paynters are much perfecter that haue Å¿Ã©ene, and perfectly beheld right Anatomies, then others that onely content themÅ¿elues with the outward bare Å¿hew of the Superficies, Å¿o it is with PerÅ¿pectiue workes; for they that wel vnderÅ¿tand and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly beare in minde the hidden lines, they Å¿hall better vnderÅ¿tand the At to then others, that content themÅ¿elues only with y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Å¿hew of outward Superficies.

Wherefore a man muÅ¿t imagine that the round Body lying below in his foureÅ¿quare is made, and Å¿hall Å¿erue for the two Bowes on the Å¿ides. This Body then being made (as I haue Å¿hewed before) and as you Å¿Ã©e it better now, you muÅ¿t firÅ¿t Å¿et it, where the Arches begin about the HoriÅ¿on. And the Å¿ame Perpendicular lines which Å¿tand corner wiÅ¿e from the middle of the foure cornerd body, muÅ¿t be Å¿et like Paralel lines on the right &amp; left Å¿ides vpwards from the two Arches, there (at it is afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿aid) to direct the HoriÅ¿entall lines, as you may Å¿Ã©e it plainely in the Figure. But you muÅ¿t vnderÅ¿tand, that the two croÅ¿Å¿es below in this Body, are the two Centers to draw the Å¿tones of the Arches both aboue and below, they alÅ¿o Å¿ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie the Centers of the Bowes vpon the HoriÅ¿entall lines within the Arches.</p>

And that litle doore vpon the yetting, Å¿hall Å¿tand right in the middle aboue the loweÅ¿t doore, and Å¿hall be two foote broad. In the other corner of this firÅ¿t HouÅ¿e, there Å¿hall be another doore, the wideneÅ¿Å¿e thereof Å¿hall be Å¿ixe foote; you may make it round or Å¿quare aboue as you wil. But why doe I Å¿pend my time to Å¿et downe all theÅ¿e meaÅ¿ures, which you may Å¿o plainely Å¿Ã©e in the Figure; onely it is neceÅ¿Å¿ary to warne Å¿uch as are Å¿tudious herein, that what worke Å¿oeuer a man rayÅ¿eth out of the ground, conÅ¿iÅ¿teth in three principall things, that is, in length, bredth and height. The length is of certaine HouÅ¿es or Roomes, containing a certaine number of fÃ©et. The bredth conÅ¿iÅ¿teth of Windowes, Doores, Gates, Shoppes, and Å¿uch like things. The height conÅ¿iÅ¿teth of Portes, Windowes, Iettings, Cornices, Columnes, Rooffes, and Å¿uch like things. But there is yet another, that is of the thickeneÅ¿Å¿e of the Walles, Pillars, Columnes and PilaiÅ¿ters: The length is taken from the Å¿hortening Quadrants, and from thence alÅ¿o you take the bredth. But the height is taken out of the bredth in the Quadrants, which bredth muÅ¿t be taken from the Quadran or halfe Quadran, which toucheth it on the hithermoÅ¿t fide as it Å¿tandeth: as alÅ¿o from the hithermoÅ¿t doore, which is ten foote high, there you muÅ¿t take the meaÅ¿ure from the Quadrans, which come to the Paralels on the nethermoÅ¿t corner or poynt of the doore; for if there you take fiue Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drans in bredth, it Å¿hall be height within the Antipagementum. And that which I haue Å¿ayd of theÅ¿e doores, you muÅ¿t alÅ¿o vnderÅ¿tand of all the other things: The thickeneÅ¿Å¿e of the Wall is two foote, for you Å¿ee it containeth a Quadrant. The bearing euer of the Å¿econd HouÅ¿e is of Å¿ixe foote, meaÅ¿ured vpon the ground: the like alÅ¿o the bearing oner or Å¿et<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the firÅ¿t HouÅ¿e containeth. To conclude all things, as I haue Å¿aid, riÅ¿ing out of the ground on all Å¿ides, I haue Å¿et no Cornices, nor any other ornaments in this Figure, that you may the eaÅ¿ier vnderÅ¿tand it; but a man of ripe iudgement and vnderÅ¿tanding knowing the terminations, can by his owne inuention helpe himÅ¿elfe to make faire Buildings. And for that I may not Å¿pend too much time herein, I will make others to giue you more light therein.</p>

                     <p>THE Stayres, degrÃ©es or goings vp, are very neceÅ¿Å¿ary in Buildings, and therefore I will Å¿hew diuers kinds thereof, and firÅ¿t I will begin with the eaÅ¿ieÅ¿t. According to common cuÅ¿tome a Stayre or Å¿tep is about halfe a foote high, and about a foote broad vpon the Å¿tep; then let the Å¿quare Å¿tones of this ground be a foote Å¿quare, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with we will make a paire of Å¿taires of fiue foote high, and thrÃ©e foote broad: at the foote of the ground wee will take the meaÅ¿ure of the bredth, which both on the right and left Å¿ides Å¿hall be Å¿et in Perpendicular lines on the Corners of the Stayres, which Å¿hall be deuided into ten, as the lines <hi>A. B.</hi> Å¿hew you. Then all the parts of <hi>A. B.</hi> Å¿hall be raiÅ¿ed to the HoriÅ¿on, and then you Å¿hall take nine Quadrantes vpwards in length: and where as two lines are Å¿et vp cutting through the HoriÅ¿ental lines of <hi>A. B.</hi> there the corners <hi>D. C.</hi> of the vppermoÅ¿t Å¿teps Å¿halbe, containing a foure Å¿quare of thrÃ©e Quadrants on each Å¿ide. From the hithermoÅ¿t points of the Å¿ame vpperÅ¿teps, you Å¿hal draw two helding lines to the loweÅ¿t Å¿teps; againÅ¿t the which the HoriÅ¿entall and the Perpendicular lines of the Quadran Å¿hall come together and Å¿hut vp the Stayres.</p>
                     <p>TheÅ¿e Stayres are Å¿hortened on the one Å¿ide, and the other is plaine or profil, and containeth a Å¿tep leÅ¿Å¿e in the height, which maketh foure foote and a halfe; it is alÅ¿o thrÃ©e foote broad, as it is marked vnder it on the ground. By this rule you may make Stayres or degrÃ©es as high as you will, and make Å¿ome reÅ¿ting places in the way: alwayes taking the meaÅ¿ure from the foote of the ground, as well of the Å¿hortening, as of thoÅ¿e that are vpright.</p>

                     <p>THE going vp being plaine or profil maketh a great Å¿how, and yet are very eaÅ¿ie to Å¿et in all places, I meane in the turning, and may Å¿erue for many things, Å¿pecially in Buildings, where a man going vp Å¿oftly and with eaÅ¿e, giueth the beholders a kind of pleaÅ¿ure to view them, principally in common places, for that there is a going vp on eyther Å¿ide, Å¿o that vpon the one Å¿ide men may goe vp, and on the other Å¿ide they may goe downe; and although there are only but two goings vp, yet by this a man by his own inuention may deuiÅ¿e others. How theÅ¿e Stayres are made, and with what reaÅ¿on, you may by the Figure perceaue them, although I Å¿hould Å¿ay nothing thereof: for as it is Å¿ayd before, the Quadrants are of a foote broad, and the Å¿teps halfe a foot high, and Å¿o the bredth of the Å¿tep is one foot. The bredth of the Stayres is fiue foote, both the firÅ¿t and Å¿econd: The reÅ¿ting gate containeth in wideneÅ¿Å¿e thrÃ©e foote, and is Å¿ixe foote high; which although it Å¿eemeth to be Å¿hut, and a Å¿mall doore opening in it: yet it may be made whole open and otherwiÅ¿e cloÅ¿ed. The two Å¿ides aboue the thrÃ©e Å¿teps are fiue foote broad, although here it is but one foote, becauÅ¿e of the narrowneÅ¿Å¿e of the Paper. The Perpendicular lines on the Å¿ides, Å¿ignifie leaning places, and they Å¿hould Å¿erue well alÅ¿o to the Å¿teps, but leÅ¿t they Å¿hould comber the worke, I haue leÅ¿t them out.</p>

                     <p>AMongÅ¿t other things which Å¿how well in PerÅ¿pectiue worke, I finde that goings vp or Å¿teps are very Å¿Ã©e mely, and the ottner that they turne, the better they Å¿hew; therefore I haue made theÅ¿e two goings vp turning, which Å¿tand in profil, yet you Å¿Ã©e the ground and the Å¿teps. This firÅ¿t going vp is Å¿ixe foote high and three foote broad, as you may Å¿Ã©e it marked in the ground with pricks: the reÅ¿ting place betwÃ©ene the firÅ¿t and Å¿econd going vp, is two foure Å¿quares long, which is neceÅ¿Å¿ary, becauÅ¿e of the turning. At the end thereof you finde a Portale, the dore thereof is two foote wyde, the Antipagmentum is halfe a foote on eyther Å¿ide, Å¿o that the place is three footefull. The Perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicular lines on the right Å¿ide of the plaine, Å¿ignifie certaine leanings, which may bee made of Iron, Wood, or Stone; the like may be made along the Stayres both vpward and downeward, Å¿etting a BaluÅ¿ter vpon euery Stayre: The height of this raile or leaning, Å¿hall be two foote and an halfe; for Å¿o it is caÅ¿ie to lay a mans hand vpon. How theÅ¿e Stayres are made vpwards out of the ground, although it may well be Å¿Ã©ene by the Figure without declaring it: yet I will Å¿ay Å¿ome thing thereof, to eaÅ¿e them that are Å¿hort of memory. The reÅ¿ting gate or round doore vnder the plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e betweene the Å¿econd and the third going vp, is no deeper then to the wall: Aboue the Å¿ame doore there Å¿tandeth an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other going vp, of foure Å¿teps, which to make, I haue Å¿ufficiently Å¿hewed; otherwiÅ¿e a man Å¿hould continue the ground at the reÅ¿ting doore, to draw them vp from it.</p>

The two Arches vnder the two goings vp are each a foot in thickeneÅ¿Å¿e, whereby a go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing downe is foure foote within, and is alÅ¿o drawen out of the ground as the reÅ¿t are. The other goings vp, which you Å¿Ã©e through the Arches; you may Å¿ufficiently perceiue by them how they are made: and Å¿o it is with the two paire of Stayres on the left hand, for from the firÅ¿t Å¿teps at the reÅ¿ting doore, you may eaÅ¿ily Å¿Ã©e how they are rayÅ¿ed vp out of the ground, and aboue at the end of them they haue a piece of plaine ground to come to the other Stayres, which alÅ¿o is drawne vp out of the pauement as the reÅ¿t are, that is, each Å¿tep halfe a foote high, and a foote broad. But it is hard to meaÅ¿ure in Å¿o Å¿mall things, but it Å¿uffiÅ¿eth that hereby you may Å¿ee the manner thereof: and when you make them great you Å¿hall find that they will come well inough to paÅ¿Å¿e. Vnder the Stayres laÅ¿t named, there Å¿tandeth alÅ¿o a round doore which is fiue foot wyde: vpon this ground, and on theÅ¿e Stayres a cunning Paynter might place diuers Figures in Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall formes, eyther Å¿tanding or Å¿itting vpon the Stayres; and lying vpon the ground in Å¿hortening manner, and that in this wiÅ¿e: You may place the Figures where you will with fÃ©ete, and then take Å¿ixe fÃ©ete or Å¿quares whereon they Å¿tand, and that Å¿hal be their height, for that it is the height of a common or ordinary man: this you muÅ¿t obÅ¿erue both before and behind, and in euery place. If the Figure be vpon a Å¿tep, then take the meaÅ¿ure of that Å¿tep whereon it Å¿tandeth, and make it twelue Å¿teps high, which Å¿hall be fire foote: And is the Figure lying, doe the like; but if it lieth in Å¿hortening manner vpon the ground, then you muÅ¿t take the length by the Å¿hortening Quadrant.</p>

                     <p>I Haue Å¿hewed many kinds of goings vp, but there are other kinds, and he that is not well inÅ¿tructed in the former will hardly vnderÅ¿tand theÅ¿e two which I haue here Å¿et downe. The firÅ¿t Å¿hall be winding Stayres in foure Å¿quare, and he that can make theÅ¿e foure Å¿quare Stayres, may well make the round Stayres, for it is all one thing, Å¿pecially if he vÅ¿eth the rule before Å¿et downe of the round bodies.</p>
                     <p>The Figure <hi>P.</hi> is the ground of this winding Stayre, but it is much leÅ¿Å¿e then the vppermoÅ¿t to get ground. This foure Å¿quare ground in Å¿hortening you muÅ¿t make halfe a foote high, which Å¿halbe for the firÅ¿t Å¿tep. Then before at either end, you muÅ¿t make a Perpendicular line vpright, and in it make as many halfe fÃ©ete as you deÅ¿ire to make the Stayres high; you muÅ¿t alÅ¿o place the like Perpendicular lines betwÃ©ene the middle, &amp; the corners: then you muÅ¿t draw the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations both on the right and the left Å¿ides vpwards to the HoriÅ¿on, which muÅ¿t cut through the Perpendicular lines, which are drawne out of the terminations of the Å¿teps; and of the Å¿ame height that the two cornerd Perpendicular lines are: and of the Å¿ame meaÅ¿ure you muÅ¿t make the other two Perpendicular lines betwÃ©ene the corners and the middle. Then in the middlemoÅ¿t termination of the ground you muÅ¿t place an other Perpendicular line, and deuide it alÅ¿o in halfe fÃ©et, as the other Perpendicular line on the Å¿ide is: So out of this Perpendicular line of the Centers againÅ¿t the nÃ©ereÅ¿t Perpendicular line beneath on the left hand, you muÅ¿t frame the firÅ¿t Å¿tep with two lines: The Å¿econd Å¿tep you Å¿hal alÅ¿o frame and Å¿hut vp out of the Perpendicular line of the Centers in the corner following. Then from that poynt or corner you muÅ¿t draw a line to the HoriÅ¿on, which againÅ¿t the Å¿econd Perpendicular line will make the termination of the third Å¿tep, which Å¿hall alÅ¿o bee Å¿hut about, according to the aforeÅ¿aid rule: from that poynt or corner of the Å¿tep you muÅ¿t alÅ¿o make an Hor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

TheÅ¿e Stayres muÅ¿t thus bee made. FirÅ¿t, you muÅ¿t make a foure Å¿quare Å¿hortening body of halfe a foot high, vpon this you muÅ¿t draw two Diagonall lines, and from the corner inwards there Å¿hall be a foote broad left on eyther Å¿ide, and the terminations thereof drawne to the HoriÅ¿on, and Å¿o from the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonall lines you Å¿hall Å¿ee the corners of the Å¿econd Å¿tep.

But becauÅ¿e that this eyght Å¿quare columne is too much Å¿Ã©ene on the Å¿ides, the readier to make it out of the foure Å¿quare: I haue therefore made an other piece by it, the which, becauÅ¿e it draweth neerer to this HoriÅ¿on, is Å¿Ã©ene more before, then the other, although not Å¿o long; for it is but halfe Å¿o long as the other, as you may Å¿Ã©e &amp; tell it in the ground or foot thereof.

                        <p>And becauÅ¿e the preparation for Comedies are done in thrÃ©e Å¿orts, that is, Comical, Tragical and Satiricall; I will firÅ¿t entreat of the Comicall, whereof the HouÅ¿es muÅ¿t be made as if they were for common or ordinarie people, which for the moÅ¿t part muÅ¿t be made vnder roofes in a Hall, which at the end thereof hath a chamber for the pleaÅ¿ure or eaÅ¿e of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> perÅ¿onages: and there it is that the ground of the Scaffold is made (as I Å¿aid and Å¿hewed before) in the profil. Therefore <hi>C.</hi> is the firÅ¿t part being the flat Scaffold; and Å¿uppoÅ¿e that each Quadran containeth two foote on eyther Å¿ide, Å¿o Å¿hal they vpon the hanging Scaffold before on the BaÅ¿e be alÅ¿o two foot broad, which is marked <hi>B.</hi> And (as I Å¿ayd before) my meaning is not to place the HoriÅ¿on hereof againÅ¿t the backe behind in the Scaffold, but as farre as it is from the beginning of the pauement <hi>B.</hi> to the wall, Å¿o farre I would alÅ¿o that men Å¿hall paÅ¿Å¿e behinde through the wall, and Å¿o Å¿hall all the houÅ¿es and other things Å¿how better in the Å¿hortening: and when by conuenient diÅ¿tances you haue drawne all the Quadrans towards the HoriÅ¿on, &amp; Å¿hortened them, then you muÅ¿t Å¿horten the houÅ¿es right with the foure Å¿quare Å¿tones; which houÅ¿es are the great lines marked vpon the ground, aÅ¿well for thoÅ¿e that Å¿tand vpright, as thoÅ¿e that Å¿horten. All Å¿uch houÅ¿es I alwayes made of Å¿pars, or rafter or laths, couered with linnin cloth; making doores and windowes, both before and in the Å¿hortening, as occaÅ¿ion fell out. I haue alÅ¿o made Å¿ome things of halfe planks of wood, which were great helpe to the Paynters to Å¿et out things at life. All the Å¿paces fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> the backe to the wall marked <hi>A.</hi> Å¿hall be for the perÅ¿onages, to the which end the hindermoÅ¿t backe in the middle Å¿hall Å¿tand at the leaÅ¿t two foot from the wall, that the perÅ¿onages may goe from the one Å¿ide to the other, and not be Å¿Ã©ene. Then you muÅ¿t rayÅ¿e a termination at the beginning of the pauement <hi>B.</hi> which Å¿hall be the poynt <hi>L.</hi> and from thence to the HoriÅ¿on there Å¿halbe a line drawne, as it is marked in the profil with prickes, which Å¿hall be of like height; and where that toucheth the hindermoÅ¿t backe of the Scene or Scaffold, there the HoriÅ¿on of that backe Å¿hall Å¿tand: and that HoriÅ¿on Å¿hall Å¿erue onely for that backe. But if you Å¿tretch a corde or any other thing to the termination <hi>L.</hi> then you may faÅ¿ten a thread to it, to thruÅ¿t backward or forward, to vÅ¿e it out of the Å¿tedfaÅ¿t HoriÅ¿on, &amp; all the Ortographie of the houÅ¿es before. But the HoriÅ¿on which goeth through the wall, Å¿hall Å¿erue for all the Å¿hortening Å¿ides of the houÅ¿es: and for that men Å¿hould breake the wall, if they would vÅ¿e all this HoriÅ¿on in groÅ¿Å¿e, which may not bee done, therefore I haue alwayes made a Å¿mall modell of wood and Paper iuÅ¿t of the Å¿ame bignes, and by the Å¿ame modell Å¿et it downe in groÅ¿Å¿e, from piece to piece.

                        <p>HOuÅ¿es for Tragedies, muÅ¿t bee made for great perÅ¿onages, for that actions of loue, Å¿trange aduentures, and cruell murthers, (as you reade in ancient and moderne Tragedies) happen alwayes in the houÅ¿es of great Lords, Dukes, Princes, and Kings. Therefore in Å¿uch caÅ¿es you muÅ¿t make none but Å¿tately houÅ¿es, as you Å¿Ã©e it hore in this Figure; wherein (for that it is Å¿o Å¿mal) I could make no Princely Pallaces: but it is Å¿ufficient for the workeman to Å¿Ã©e the manner thereof, whereby he may helpe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elfe as time and place Å¿erueth: and (as I Å¿ayde in the Comicall) hee muÅ¿t alwayes Å¿tudy to pleaÅ¿e the eyes of the beholders, and forget not himÅ¿elfe Å¿o much as to Å¿et a Å¿mall building in Å¿tead of a great, for the reaÅ¿ons aforeÅ¿ayd. And for that I haue made all my Scenes of laths, couered with linnen, yet Å¿ometime it is neceÅ¿Å¿ary to make Å¿ome things riÅ¿ing or boÅ¿Å¿ing out; which are to bee made of wood, like the houÅ¿es on the left Å¿ide, whereof the Pillars, although they Å¿horten, Å¿tand all vpon one BaÅ¿e, with Å¿ome Å¿tayres, all co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered ouer with cloth, the Cornices bearing out, which you muÅ¿t obÅ¿erue to the middle part: But to giue place to the Galleries, you muÅ¿t Å¿et the other Å¿hortening Cloth Å¿omewhat backwards, and make a cornice aboue it, as you Å¿ee: and that which I Å¿peake of theÅ¿e Buildings, you muÅ¿t vnderÅ¿tand of all the reÅ¿t, but in the Buildings which Å¿tand far backward the Painting worke, muÅ¿t Å¿up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie the place by Å¿hadowes without any bearing out: touching the artificiall lights, I haue Å¿poken thereof in the Comicall works. All that you make aboue the Roofe Å¿ticking out, as Chimneyes, Towers, Piramides, ObliÅ¿ces, and other Å¿uch like things or Images; you muÅ¿t make them all of thin bords, cut out round, and well colloured: But if you make any flat Buildings, they muÅ¿t Å¿tand Å¿ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what farre inward, that you may not Å¿ee them on the Å¿ides. In theÅ¿e Scenes, although Å¿ome haue painted perÅ¿onages therein like Å¿upporters, as in a Gallery, or doore, as a Dog, Cat, or any other beaÅ¿ts: I am not of that opinion, for that Å¿tandeth too long without Å¿tirring or moouing; but if you make Å¿uch a thing to lie Å¿lÃ©eping, that I hold withall. You may alÅ¿o make Images, HiÅ¿tories, or Fables of Marble, or other matter againÅ¿t a wall; but to repreÅ¿ent the life, they ought to Å¿tirre. In the latter end of this Booke I will Å¿hew you how to make them.</p>

Take a piece of Salamoniacke, and put it into a Barbers BaÅ¿en, or Å¿uch like thing, and put water into it: then bruÅ¿e and cruÅ¿h the Salamoniacke Å¿oftly therein, till it be all molten, alwayes putting more water vnto it, as you deÅ¿ire to haue it light or Å¿ad collour; which done, if you will haue it fayre and cleare, then Å¿traine it through a fine cloth into an other veÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ell, and then it will be a cleare CeleÅ¿tiall blew, whereof you may make diuers kinds of blew with water. Will you make an Emerauld collour, then put Å¿ome Saffron as you will haue it pale or high colloured; for heere it is not neceÅ¿Å¿ary to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿cribe you any weight or meaÅ¿ure, for that experience will teach you bow to doe it. If you will make a Rubbie collour, if you bee in a place where you may haue red Wine. then you nÃ©ed not vÅ¿e any other thing; but to make it pall with water, us need requireth: but if you can get no wine, then take Brazill beaten to powder, &amp; put it into a Kettell of water with Allum, let it Å¿Ã©ethe, and Å¿kum it well; then Å¿trayne it, and vÅ¿e it with water and Vinneger. If you will counterfeit a Ballayes, you muÅ¿t make it of red and white Wine mingled together; but white Wine alone will Å¿howe like a Topas or a CriÅ¿olite? The Conduit or common water being Å¿trayned, will be like a Diamond, and to doe this well, you muÅ¿t vpon a glaÅ¿Å¿ie ground frame certaine points or tablets, and fill them with wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.

And behind the glaÅ¿Å¿es you muÅ¿t Å¿et great Lampes, that the light may alÅ¿o be Å¿tedfaÅ¿t: and if the bottels or other veÅ¿Å¿els of glaÅ¿Å¿e on the Å¿ide where the light Å¿tands were flat, or rather hollow, it would Å¿how the clearer, and the collours moÅ¿t excellent and fayre; the like muÅ¿t be done with the holes on the Å¿hortening Å¿ide: But if you nÃ©ed a great light to Å¿how more then the reÅ¿t, then Å¿et a torch behind, and behind the torch a bright BaÅ¿on; the brightnes whereof will Å¿hew like the beames of the Sunne. You may alÅ¿o make glaÅ¿Å¿e of all collours and formes, Å¿ome foure Å¿quare, Å¿ome with croÅ¿Å¿es, &amp; any other forme with their light behind them. Now all the lights Å¿eruing for the collours, Å¿hal not be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Å¿ame which muÅ¿t light the Scene, for you muÅ¿t haue a great number of torches before the Scene. You may alÅ¿o place certaine candleÅ¿tickes aboue the Scene with great candles therein, and aboue the candleÅ¿ticks you may place Å¿ome veÅ¿Å¿els with water, wherein you may put a piece of Camphir, which burning, will Å¿how a very good light, and Å¿mell well. Sometime it may chance that you muÅ¿t make Å¿ome thing or other which Å¿hould Å¿Ã©eme to burne, which you muÅ¿t wet throughly with excellent good Aquauite; and Å¿etting it on fire with a candle it will burne all ouer: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I could Å¿peake more of theÅ¿e fires, yet this Å¿hal Å¿uffice for this time; &amp; I will Å¿peake of Å¿ome things that are pleaÅ¿ing to the behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.

If it be requiÅ¿ite to make a Planet or any other thing to paÅ¿Å¿e along in the Ayre, it muÅ¿t bee framed and cut out of paÅ¿te-board; then in the hindermoÅ¿t and backe part of the houÅ¿es of the Scene, there muÅ¿t be a piece of wire drawne aboue in the roofe of the houÅ¿e and made faÅ¿t with certain rings behind to the paÅ¿te-board painted with a Planet or any other thing that Å¿halbe drawne Å¿oftly by a man with a blacke thrÃ©ed from one end to the other, but it muÅ¿t be farre from mens Å¿ight, that neither of the thrÃ©eds may bee Å¿Ã©ene. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time you Å¿hall haue occaÅ¿ion to Å¿hew thunder and lightning as the play requireth; then you muÅ¿t make thunder in this manner: com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly all Scenes are made at the end of a great Hall, whereas vÅ¿ually there is a Chamber aboue it, wherein you muÅ¿t roule a great Bullet of a Cannon or of Å¿ome other great Ordinance, and then counterfeit Thunder.

                        <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Mong all the ancient building to bee Å¿eene in Rome, I am of opinion, that the Pantheon (for one piece of worke alone) is the fayreÅ¿t, wholeÅ¿t, and beÅ¿t to be vnderÅ¿tood; and is Å¿o much the more wonderfull then the reÅ¿t, becauÅ¿e it hath Å¿o many members, which are all Å¿o correÅ¿pondent one to the other, that whoÅ¿oeuer beholdeth it, taketh great pleaÅ¿ure therein, which proceedeth from this, that the excellent workeman, which inuented it, choÅ¿e the perfiteÅ¿t forme, that is, the round forme, whereby it is vÅ¿ually called, Our Lady of the Round: for within, it is as high as it is broad. And it may be, that the Å¿ayd workeman, conÅ¿idering, that all things proceeding orderly, haue a principall and onely head, whereon the nether parts depend, was of opinion, that this piece of worke Å¿hould haue onely but one light, and that, in the higheÅ¿t part thereof, that it might Å¿pread abroad in all places alike, as in effect you Å¿ee it doth: for beÅ¿ides other things which haue their perfect light, there are Å¿ixe Chappels, which (for that they Å¿tand within the thickneÅ¿Å¿e of the wall) Å¿hould be darke, yet they haue their due light, by the meanes of Å¿ome drawing windowes, aboue in the top of the Å¿ayd Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels, which giue them Å¿econd light, taken from the vppermoÅ¿t hole, Å¿o that there is not any Å¿mall thing in them, but it receiueth a part of the light, (and this is not made without great iudgement:) for this Temple, in old time, being dedicated to all the gods, by which meanes there Å¿tood many Images in it, (which the diuers Tabernacles, Seates, and Å¿mall windowes Å¿hew) it was neceÅ¿Å¿ary that euery one had his due light. Wherefore Å¿uch as take pleaÅ¿ure to make Images, and other imboÅ¿Å¿ed or grauen worke, muÅ¿t conÅ¿ider, that Å¿uch a Cabinet Å¿hould haue his light from aboue, that euery one, Å¿tanding in his place, neede not looke for light to Å¿ee, but that they may bee Å¿eene altogether at one time. But to come to my firÅ¿t Å¿peach: For that the Pantheon Å¿eemeth vnto me to be the perfecteÅ¿t peece of worke that euer I Å¿aw, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I thought it good to Å¿et it firÅ¿t in the beginning of this Booke, and for a principall head of all other peeces of worke. The founder of this Temple (as <hi>Plinie</hi> writeth in more then one place) was <hi>Marcus Agrippa,</hi> to accompliÅ¿h <hi>AuguÅ¿tus CaeÅ¿ars</hi> laÅ¿t will, who being intercepted by death, could not finiÅ¿h it: and Å¿o it was built about foureteene yeeres after the byrth of our Lord, which is about 5203. yeeres from the beginning of the world.</p>
                     <p>In this Temple (as <hi>Pliny</hi> writeth) the Capitals were of Copper; and hee writeth alÅ¿o, that <hi>Diogenes,</hi> the Image-maker of Athens, made the excellent Caracters in the Pillars, and that the Images placed aboue the FronteÅ¿picium were much commended, although by the highneÅ¿Å¿e of the place they could not be Å¿o well diÅ¿cerned. This Temple was conÅ¿umed with lightening, and burnt, about the 12. yeere of the raigne of the Emperour <hi>Traian,</hi> which was about 113. yeeres after the byrth of ChriÅ¿t, and in the 5311. yeere of the creation of the world: and <hi>Lucius Septimus Seuerus,</hi> and <hi>Marcus Aurelius Antonius,</hi> repayred it agayne, with all the Ornaments thereto belonging, as it appeareth in the Architraue of the Å¿ayd frame: which Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments, you muÅ¿t preÅ¿ume, were all new made, otherwiÅ¿e the Caracters of <hi>Diogenes</hi> would Å¿till haue bene Å¿eene there. But in truth, the workman that made it, was very iudicious and conÅ¿tant; for that he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned the members thereof very iudiciouÅ¿ly to the body, and would not Å¿uppreÅ¿Å¿e the worke with many cuttings: but as I will Å¿hew, when time Å¿erueth, how to place and deuide them excellent well. AlÅ¿o, in all the worke, hee hath obÅ¿erued the worke of Corinth, and would mixe no other with it: and withall, the meaÅ¿ures of all the members are as well obÅ¿erued as euer I Å¿aw or meaÅ¿ured in any other peece of worke, whereby we may call this Temple an example of workemanÅ¿hip. But leauing this matter (for that it giueth the workeman little, or no inÅ¿truction to the purpoÅ¿e) I will proceede to the particular mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ures: and that I may goe forward orderly in theÅ¿e Antiquities, the firÅ¿t Figure Å¿hall be the Ichnography. The Å¿econd, the Orthography. The third, the Sciography.</p>

                     <p>This Figure following is the Ichnography, that is, the ground of the Temple aforeÅ¿ayd, which is meaÅ¿u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the ancient, or old RomiÅ¿h Palmes placed along by the Å¿ide hereof. And firÅ¿t, Å¿peaking of the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, whereof the Columnes are 6. Palmes &amp; 29. minutes thicke. The Intercolumnes (which are the Å¿pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces from one Columne to another) are 8. Palmes and 9. minutes: the breadth of the Portall is 40. Palmes: the breadth of the flat Pillars of the Portall, is like the Diameter of the Columnes: the breadth of the Seates betweene the Pillars, is 10. Palmes: and the PilaÅ¿ters on the Å¿ides are 2. Palmes: the wideneÅ¿Å¿e of the Gates is 26. Palmes and a halfe: the wideneÅ¿Å¿e of the whole Temple (that is, of the Floore within, from one wall to another) is 194. Palmes: and iuÅ¿t Å¿o much is the height from the Floore to the vndermoÅ¿t Å¿tone of the window aboue. The Å¿ayd round hole is 36. Palmes and a halfe broad: each of the Å¿ixe Chappels that are made within the thickneÅ¿Å¿e of the wall, are 26. Palmes, and 30. minutes; and goe halfe as deepe into the wall as the thickneÅ¿Å¿e of the foure Å¿quare Pillars on each Å¿ide. But the principall Chappell is thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie Palmes broad, and alÅ¿o is an halfe Circle, beÅ¿ides the Pillars aforeÅ¿ayd. The thickneÅ¿Å¿e of the Columnes of all the Chappels, is 5. Palmes, 3. minutes leÅ¿Å¿e: the foure Å¿quare corner Pillars alÅ¿o of the Å¿ayd Chappels, contayning as much. The Columnes of the Tabernacle betweene the Chappels are two Palmes thicke: the thickneÅ¿Å¿e of the wall that goeth round about the whole body of the Temple, is 31. Palmes. And although that the Chappels make the walles hollow, yet betweene them there are hollow places made within the walles, which Å¿ome Å¿ay, were left for places to receiue wind, becauÅ¿e of earthquakes. But I am of opinion, that they were left Å¿o vnfilled, to Å¿pare Å¿tuffe, becauÅ¿e they are made circlewiÅ¿e, and are Å¿trong inough. The going vp, which you Å¿ee here on the left Å¿ide, was alÅ¿o on the right Å¿ide, to go vp the Portall: men alÅ¿o went from thence round about the Temple, ouer the Chappels, through a Å¿ecret way, which is yet there: through the which alÅ¿o, they went without on the Å¿teps, to clime vp into the higheÅ¿t parts of the buildings, with many goings vp which are round about it. It is thought, that this foundation was all one maÅ¿Å¿e or lumpe, and without, many places hollow, Å¿o that Å¿ome neighbours marking it, and Å¿eeking to build, haue found Å¿uch a foundation when they digged.</p>
                     <p>This is the old RomiÅ¿h Palme, which is deuided into twelue fingers, and each finger is deuided into foure parts, which are called Minutes, by the which meaÅ¿ure this preÅ¿ent Figure, with all the parts following, was meaÅ¿ured.</p>

                        <p>THE Figure hereunder, Å¿heweth the whole forme of the Pantheon right before, and although at this time men go downe into it by certaine Å¿teps; yet as it was made at the firÅ¿t it was Å¿euen Å¿teps aboue the ground. It is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that Å¿uch and Å¿o old a piece of worke is yet whole and Å¿tanding Å¿till, for that the foundation was not Å¿paringly made; for it is thought that it was once as broad againe vnder as it is aboue, as it had beene found by the neighbour workemen: but let vs proceed to the particular meaÅ¿ure thereof from the earth vpwards. I Å¿ayd before, that the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Columens of the Portal is Å¿ixe Palmes &amp; nine and twenty minutes, but the height is foure and fiftie Palmes and nine and twentie minutes, without the BaÅ¿es and Capitals: the BaÅ¿es are thrÃ©e Palmes and ninetÃ©ene minutes high, and the Capitals Å¿euen Palmes and Å¿euen and thirtie minutes high; the height of the Architrane is fiue Palmes, the FrÃ©eÅ¿e is fiue Palmes and thirtÃ©ene minutes high; the Cornice is foure Palmes and nine minutes high, aboue from the top or Scina of the Cornice, to the poynt of the Geuell, are foure and thirtie Palmes, and nine and thirtie minutes. The Timpanum, that is, the flat part of the Gewell, is thought to haue bene adorned with Å¿iluer images, althought it is not Å¿et downe in writing; but conÅ¿idering the great power of Å¿uch Emperors, I am perÅ¿waded that it was Å¿o, for if the Goathes, Wandals, or other nations (which Å¿poyled <hi>Rome</hi> more then once) had beene deÅ¿irous or couetous of Copper, they might haue taken it from the Architraues and other Ornamento in Portals in great abundance: but let it be as it will, there are Figures and tokens Å¿Ã©ene, which Å¿hew that there were Figures and tokens of Mettall Å¿tanding thereon.</p>

                        <p>THis Figure following Å¿heweth the Pantheon within, which forme (as I Å¿aid) is taken from Sphera, becauÅ¿e it is Å¿o wide from one wall vnto the other, as it is high from the Pauement to the open place vpon the top thereof; which wideneÅ¿Å¿e and height are both a hundred ninetie and foure Palmes vpwards, from the Pauement to the higheÅ¿t; and from the Cornice to the higheÅ¿t part of the roofe is alÅ¿o the Å¿ame meaÅ¿ure, that is, each the halfe of one hundred ninetie and foure Palmes. The Quadrants in the roofe are all like that in the middle; and it is thought that they were alÅ¿o beautified ouer with Siluer plate by certaine remnants thereof yet remayning to be Å¿eene: for if they had beene of Copper, they would yet be Å¿Ã©ene there, or elÅ¿e thoÅ¿e ouer the Portals would alÅ¿o haue beene taken away.</p>
                        <p>Let no man wonder that in theÅ¿e things (requiring PerÅ¿pectiue Arte) that there is no Pauement or other Å¿hortening Å¿Ã©ene, but I make it onely out of the ground to Å¿hew the meaÅ¿ure of the height thereof, that you might not miÅ¿Å¿e it by Å¿hortening: But in the Booke of PerÅ¿pectiue Arte theÅ¿e things are Å¿hewed in their right Å¿hortening manner (and that in diuers wayes) that is to Å¿ay, in Superficies, and many bodies, and diuers Å¿orts of houÅ¿es, Å¿eruing thereunto: I will not now Å¿et downe the meaÅ¿ure of Cornices downewards, for hereafter I will Å¿hew the Figures piece by piece, and thereof Å¿et downe a Å¿euerall meaÅ¿ure.</p>
                        <p>The Chappell in the middle, although here it Å¿howeth well with the other worke, yet many men are of opinion that it is not ancient, becauÅ¿e the Arch thereof wanteth the fiue pillars, which is a thing neuer vÅ¿ed by good Antiquities; but it is thought that it was made greater in the ChriÅ¿tians time, as the ChriÅ¿tians Temples alwayes haue one principall Altar which is greater then the reÅ¿t.</p>

                        <p>THis Ornament is yet Å¿tanding aboue the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall of the Pantheon, which is made in this manner, all of Copper plates, the halfe Circle is not there; but there was a crooked Superficies finely made of Copper: and many men are of opinion that the beautifying thereof was of Siluer, for the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ons aforeÅ¿aid: but wherof it was, it is not well knowne; but it is true, it was excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent faire worke, conÅ¿ide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that which is yet to bee Å¿Ã©ene.</p>
                        <p>THis Figure here vnder Å¿et downe, Å¿howeth the manner of the Portall within, the which both on the Å¿ides and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is well Å¿et out with Marble, and alÅ¿o without, although by continuance of time is much defaced. The foure Pillars are caneled with Å¿uch a number of Canels, as you Å¿ee it here vnder Å¿et downe; and becauÅ¿e this round Columne is thinner aboue then the Diameter, where the edge or border of the Architrabe is as thicke as the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumne: If a man would make the Architrabe equall with the foure cornerd Pillars, which leÅ¿Å¿en not aboue, then the edge would haue had no Perpendicular, for it world haue wanted as much as the leÅ¿Å¿ening of the round Columnes. Thus the Å¿kilfull workeman hath placed the Architrabe Å¿o much right aboue the the foure Pillars, becauÅ¿e Å¿uch things Å¿how well. Touching the doores, they are twenty Palmes, and two minutes wide, and fortie Palmes and foure mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes high.

The thickeneÅ¿Å¿e of theÅ¿e Columnes is fiue Palmes thrÃ©e minutes leÅ¿Å¿e, the height of the BaÅ¿es is two Palmes and one and twenty minutes, the height of the Columnes without the Capitals is fourtie Palmes, the height of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitals is fiue Palmes and thirtie minutes; and Å¿o the whole Columne with the BaÅ¿es and Capitals: is fourtie and eight Palmes high. The height of the Architraue, FrÃ©eÅ¿e and Cornice, are altogether thirteene Palmes and a halfe, and this height in all is deuided into ten parts, whereof thrÃ©e parts are for the Architraue; the other thrÃ©e are for the Sophero or the FrÃ©eÅ¿e, and the other foure parts are for the Cornice: Touching the reÅ¿t of the other members, I Å¿et downe no meaÅ¿ures, becauÅ¿e this is proportionably declared touching the principalleÅ¿t of them that Å¿tand on the Å¿ide thÃ©ereof marked with <hi>P.</hi> And in trueth, a man in this Cornice may perceiue the iudicious Å¿kill of the workeman, who therein touching the mutiles, would not cut any deatiles therein, thereby not to fall into that common errour, wherein Å¿o many ancient workemen haue fallen, and at this day more moderne workemen. The errour I meane is this, that all the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners wherein mutiles Å¿tand, and vnder haue dentiles cut in them are vicious, and by <hi>Vitruuius</hi> are reiected in the Å¿econd Chapter in his fourth Booke: and although that in this Cornice the forme of denticles are, notwithÅ¿tanding, becauÅ¿e it is vncut, it is not to be condemned in this reÅ¿pect. Aboue this Cornice there is a Podium, or a manner of bearing out, whereof the height is Å¿euen palmes and Å¿ixe minutes, which commeth not farre out, for the Pillars Å¿tand not farre out from the Wall: the height whereof, together with the Architraue, FrÃ©eÅ¿e and Cornice, is fourtie Palmes and Å¿ixe and thirtie minutes, which height being deuided into fiue parts, the one part Å¿hall be for the Architraue.

There was in the time of Pope <hi>Iulio</hi> the Å¿econd, a workeman cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Bramant</hi> of <hi>CaÅ¿teldurante</hi> in the Dukedome of <hi>Vrbin,</hi> who was a man of Å¿o great vnderÅ¿tanding in Architec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that it might be Å¿ayd (by meanes of the ayde and performents which the Pope gone him) that hee rayÅ¿ed by good Architecture againe, which from ancient time till then had bone hidden and kept Å¿ecret: which <hi>Bramant</hi> in his time layd the foundation or beginning of the wonderfull worke of S. <hi>Peters</hi> Tempel in <hi>Rome,</hi> but being preuented by death, did not onely leane it vnfiniÅ¿hed, but the modell thereof alÅ¿o was left vnperfect, wherein diuers ingenious workemen Å¿ought to buÅ¿ie themÅ¿elues both to perfect and finiÅ¿h it; and amongÅ¿t many others <hi>Raphael Durbin,</hi> Paynter, a man alÅ¿o very Å¿kilfull in Architecture, following <hi>Bramants</hi> Å¿teps, made perfect this draught, the which in my opinion is one of the fayreÅ¿t draughts that are to be found, out of the which the ingenious workeman may helpe himÅ¿elfe in many things. I will not Å¿et downe all the meaÅ¿ures of this Tempel (becauÅ¿e that it is well proportioned) and a man may by part of the meaÅ¿ure find out the reÅ¿t.

Touching the ground of this Theater, men could not well conceaue it: but not long Å¿ince, the great Patrician of <hi>Rome,</hi> going to make a houÅ¿e, the Å¿cituation whereof was to be Å¿et vpon part of the Theater (this houÅ¿e was made by one <hi>BalthaÅ¿ar</hi> of Sienna, an excellent workman) and as he cauÅ¿ed the foundation to be digged, there were found many reliques of diuers Cornices of this Theater, and a great part of the Å¿ame Theater was diÅ¿couered, whereby <hi>BalthaÅ¿ar</hi> concerted the whole forme thereof, and meaÅ¿ured it with great circumÅ¿pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, placing it in the forme following: my Å¿elfe being at that time in <hi>Rome,</hi> Å¿aw many of the Cornices, and found friendÅ¿hip to meaÅ¿ure them, and in truth, there I found as excellent formes as euer I Å¿aw in any old Ruins, and moÅ¿t in the Capitals of Dorica, and alÅ¿o in the impoÅ¿ts of the Arches, which, me thinks, agrÃ©e well with the doctrine of <hi>Vitru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uius.</hi> LikewiÅ¿e the FreeÅ¿e, Trigliphen, and Methopen, agrÃ©e well inough: but the Dorica Cornice, although it be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry full of members, and well wrought, yet I found it to differ much from <hi>Vitruuius</hi> inÅ¿tructions: for being licencious inough of members, was of Å¿uch a height, that the two third parts of Å¿uch height Å¿hould haue bÃ©ene inough to the Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traue and the FrÃ©eÅ¿e. But I am of opinion therefore, (by the licence of theÅ¿e, or other Antiquities) that a workeman in theÅ¿e dayes Å¿hould not erre, (which error, I meane, is to doe contrary to <hi>Vitruuius</hi> precepts) nor to bee peremptory that hee will make a Cornice, or other thing iuÅ¿t of the Å¿ame proportion as hee hath Å¿Ã©ene and meaÅ¿ured, and then Å¿et it in worke; becauÅ¿e it is not Å¿ufficient for him to Å¿ay, I may doe it: for ancient workemen haue done it, without conÅ¿idera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whether it be proportioned according to the reÅ¿t of the building. BeÅ¿ides, although an old workeman was Å¿o bold, yet we muÅ¿t therefore not bee Å¿o, (but as reaÅ¿on teacheth vs) wee Å¿hould obÅ¿erue <hi>Vitruuius</hi> rules as our guide, and moÅ¿t certayne and inÅ¿allible directions: for that from that time of great Antiquity, till now, there is no man found to haue written better, nor more learnedly of Architecture then he: and as in euery Arte there is one more learned then another, to whom Å¿uch authority is giuen, that his words are fully, &amp; without doubt belÃ©eued. Who then will deny (if he be not ignorant) that <hi>Vitruuius,</hi> for Architecture, is worthy of the higheÅ¿t degrÃ©e? and that his writings where no other nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble reaÅ¿on or cauÅ¿e is to mooue vs) ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

This ground was meaÅ¿ured by the ancient foote, and firÅ¿t, Å¿peaking of the OrcheÅ¿tra <hi>A.</hi> which is halfe a Circle, the Diameter thereof is <hi>141.</hi> foot and a halfe long. The body of the Theatre, that is, from the OrcheÅ¿tra, to the outtermoÅ¿t of the Corner Pillars of the Porticus, is <hi>35.</hi> foot: the Pillars of the corner on eyther Å¿ide, is <hi>5.</hi> foote broad: the entry of the Porticus on the Å¿ide of the Scene, is <hi>8.</hi> foote: the vault vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Stayres, is <hi>22.</hi> foote: the thickeneÅ¿Å¿e of the Wall about the OrcheÅ¿tra, is <hi>3.</hi> foote and a halfe: the HoÅ¿pitalia, marked <hi>X.</hi> is in length <hi>40.</hi> foot and a halfe; and in bredth <hi>30.</hi> foote: the wideneÅ¿Å¿e of the Porticus about the Theatre, is <hi>11.</hi> foote: the Pillars are thicke and broad, <hi>3.</hi> foote and <hi>3.</hi> quarters: the wideneÅ¿Å¿e of the Arch, is <hi>9.</hi> foote: the iuÅ¿t bredth of the OrcheÅ¿tra marked <hi>B.</hi> is <hi>20.</hi> foote: the place of the Pulpit <hi>C.</hi> is in length <hi>40.</hi> foote and a halfe; but the bredth is <hi>12.</hi> foote: the going through, is <hi>9.</hi> foote. The place marked <hi>D.</hi> Å¿hould be the Porticus behind the Scene: yet there is no Å¿hew of any Columnes; but it Å¿heweth that there was a wall Å¿tanding by the water Å¿ide. The bredth of this place, is <hi>19.</hi> foot and a halfe. Without this Theatre there Å¿tandeth the foundation of two Buildings, but they are Å¿o much decayed, that you can find no end of them: neuertheleÅ¿Å¿e, the Building marked <hi>F.</hi> for as much as you Å¿ee of it, Å¿hew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that it was ioyned to other things. The wideneÅ¿Å¿e wherein the <hi>F.</hi> Å¿tandeth, is <hi>31.</hi> foote. The <hi>2.</hi> Å¿mall places or Å¿tancies holding vp the one Å¿ide, are eyght foot and a halfe; and on the other Å¿ide, ten foot and a halfe. The Arches where the foure Columnes Å¿tand (which I take be made in that manner) are in length <hi>27.</hi> foot and a halfe, and in bredth ten foot and a halfe. The bredth of the Building marked <hi>E.</hi> is twenty foot: the hollow places in the Å¿ides, are <hi>17.</hi> foote: the length of all together, is <hi>60.</hi> foote, and is diÅ¿tant from the Theatre one hundred and one and fortie foot: and from the other Building, Å¿euentie foote and a halfe.</p>

The thickeneÅ¿Å¿e and bredth are Å¿hewed before: the height of the Columnes with BaÅ¿es and Capitals, Å¿euentÃ©ene Elles: and the height of the Arches, fiftÃ©ene Elles. The height of the Cunco that is, the Å¿hutting Å¿tone aboue the Arch, is <hi>2.</hi> Elles: the height of the binding, which is in Å¿tead of an Architraue, is <hi>2.</hi> Elles, and Å¿o much is the Facie aboue it.

In which Figure, firÅ¿t you Å¿Ã©e all the degrÃ©es whereon the Spectators Å¿ate: there alÅ¿o you may perceiue how many wayes the goings vp were, which (in truth) were very eaÅ¿te to go vp &amp; downe, Å¿o that in Å¿hort time the Amphitheater was filled with a great number of men, without hindrance one of another. You may alÅ¿o Å¿Ã©e in the outward part, how the thicknes of the PilaÅ¿ters, and the walles vpwards leÅ¿Å¿ened, which on the inÅ¿ide are drawne in, and being Å¿o drawne in, giueth the building great Å¿trength: and to Å¿hew it to be true, you may Å¿Ã©e there, at this day, Å¿ome part of the Facies without, yet whole, from the top to the bottome, and yet the inward parts are decayed, and that hath the drawing inward of the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trÃ©e dens, which made the worke Å¿lighter, taking, as it were, a forme of a Piramides.

And withall, (as I Å¿ayd) the innermoÅ¿t part being Å¿o ruinous, that men Å¿Ã©e no part of the innermoÅ¿t worke, which is cut off by the line that hath Shafts or Arrowheads at the ends: and for that you Å¿Ã©e no parts thereof at all, whether that the vppermoÅ¿t parts of the higheÅ¿t Å¿teps, vpwards to the top, were all couered with double Galleries, or that the Porticus was alone, and the other left open: therefore I haue made it in two maner of wayes: the one is (as you Å¿ee in the Å¿ame Profill) ioyned with all the worke: and the other maner is, which Å¿tandeth without the degrÃ©es or Å¿teps, which order alÅ¿o agrÃ©eth with the other, if you Å¿et it Å¿o, that the two LiÅ¿ts in the PedeÅ¿tals mÃ©ete each with the other: but for that you Å¿Ã©e Å¿ome remaynders of the croÅ¿Å¿ed Roofes, which yet hang within on the walles, as the fourth ground Å¿heweth, the which, I iudge, was onely a Porticus, and that the other part was vncouered to receiue the people, and being Å¿o, muÅ¿t receiue them better then if the Galleries had bÃ©ene double: Now to turne to the beginning of the degrÃ©es or Å¿teps, that I leaue nothing vntouched, as nÃ©ere as I can, I Å¿ay, by meanes of the ruines, and filling vp with matter fallen, the playne, or the place in the middle is Å¿o filled vp, that a man cannot marke how high the firÅ¿t de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grÃ©es of the playne were eleuated: but by the inÅ¿tructions of thoÅ¿e that haue Å¿Ã©ene the end, the firÅ¿t degrÃ©e was Å¿o high, that the wild and vntamed BeaÅ¿ts could not hurt the beholders: and there was alÅ¿o a BorÅ¿twering, and other Å¿trÃ©etes, of a reaÅ¿onable bredth to go round about, as it is Å¿hewed where it is marked with <hi>C.</hi> The two open places, the leaÅ¿t and the greateÅ¿t Arch, were to bring in light.

The Å¿econd Order, is after the manner of Ionica: and although the Columnes be not fluited, yet in effect they may be called Ionica. The third Story, is after the manner of Corinthia, but firme worke without cutting, vnleÅ¿Å¿e it be the Capitals, the which with their height are not exquiÅ¿itely made. The fourth Story, is CompoÅ¿ita; other call it Latina, becauÅ¿e it was inuented by the Romanes: Å¿ome others call it Italica. But it may well be called CompoÅ¿ita, were it but for the mutiles which Å¿tand in the FrÃ©eÅ¿e, for that no other Story haue their mutiles in the FrÃ©eÅ¿e, but that. Many men aÅ¿ke why the Romanes made this Building of foure Orders, and made it not all of one forme or order as many others are, as that of <hi>Verona,</hi> which is all of ruÅ¿ticall worke, and that of <hi>Pola</hi> alÅ¿o. A man may anÅ¿were thereunto, that the old Romanes, as rulers ouer al, &amp; eÅ¿pecially of thoÅ¿e people, from whence the thrÃ©e former Orders had their beginning, would Å¿et thoÅ¿e <hi>3.</hi> generations one aboue another: &amp; aboue all thoÅ¿e orders, the CompoÅ¿ita, as found by themÅ¿elues; thereby Å¿ignifying, that they as tryumphers ouer thoÅ¿e people, would alÅ¿o tryumph with their workes, placing and mingling them at their pleaÅ¿ures. But omitting theÅ¿e reaÅ¿ons, we will procÃ©ed to the meaÅ¿ures of the outtermoÅ¿t parts and Orthographie. This Building was eleuated from the earth two degrÃ©es: the Å¿econd degrÃ©e was fiue Palmes broad, and the firÅ¿t two Palms; the height was little leÅ¿Å¿e then a Palme: the BaÅ¿e of the Columne was not two Palmes, no more is the Dorica: the Columne is foure Palmes thicke and two minutes: the height is <hi>38.</hi> Palms and <hi>5.</hi> minutes, with BaÅ¿e and Capitall: the height of the Capitall is about two Palmes: the PilaÅ¿ters on eyther Å¿ide of the Columnes, are thrÃ©e Palmes and thrÃ©e minutes: the wideneÅ¿Å¿e of the Arch is twenty Palmes, and the height is <hi>33.</hi> Palmes: from vnder the Arch, to the Architraue, is fiue Palmes and Å¿ixe minutes: the height of the Architraue is two Palmes and eyght minutes: the height of the FrÃ©eÅ¿e is thrÃ©e Palmes and two minutes: the Cornice as much. The PedeÅ¿tall of the Å¿econd Order, is eyght Palmes and ten minutes high: the height of the Columnes, with BaÅ¿es and Capitals, is fiue and thirty Palmes, the thickneÅ¿Å¿e is foure Palmes: the PilaÅ¿ters and Arches are like thoÅ¿e be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath: but the height of the Arch is thirty Palmes: from vnder the Arch, to vnder the Architraue, is fiue Palmes and Å¿ixe minutes: the height of the Architraue is thrÃ©e Palmes: the height of the FrÃ©eÅ¿e, is two Palmes and nine minutes: the height of the Cornice, is thrÃ©e Palmes and nine minutes. The PedeÅ¿tall of the fourth Order, called, CompoÅ¿ita, (hÃ©ere our Author hath forgotten the third Order, but howÅ¿oeuer, it differeth not much from the Ionica) the PedeÅ¿tall of the CompoÅ¿ita, is twelue Palmes high: the vnder-BaÅ¿e thereof, is foure Palmes: the height of the Pillars, with BaÅ¿es and Capitals, is thirty eyght Palmes and Å¿ixe minutes: the height of the Architraue, FrÃ©eÅ¿e, and Cornice, is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ten Palmes, deuided in thrÃ©e, one part for the Cornice, the Å¿econd for the FrÃ©eÅ¿e, wherein the Mutiles Å¿tand, and the third for the Architraue. But for what cauÅ¿e, or reaÅ¿on, the workeman Å¿et the Mutiles in the FrÃ©eÅ¿e, (things, which, peraduenture, before that time were neuer made) I haue deliuered my opinion thereof in my fourth Booke, in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Order of CompoÅ¿ita. The Pillars of the fourth Order are flat, and riÅ¿e but a little: all thereÅ¿t are round Columnes, (that is to Å¿ay) thrÃ©e fourth parts, riÅ¿ing out of the PilaÅ¿ters: the Mutiles aboue the windowes vpheld Å¿ome beames, the which are boared through with holes for men to draw cords to couer the hole Amphitheater, as well a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainÅ¿t the Sunne as the rayne: for what cauÅ¿e the Columnes are all of one thickneÅ¿Å¿e, and leÅ¿Å¿en not one more then the other (as it Å¿Ã©emeth they Å¿hould; and as <hi>Vitruuius</hi> would) as the Å¿econd Order are leÅ¿Å¿ened a fourth part, I haue alÅ¿o declared my opinion in the fourth Booke, and the ninth Chapter. In the treatiÅ¿e of making Columnes, longer or Å¿hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and that the particular members may alÅ¿o be noted, I haue marked them alÅ¿o by the Orthographie of the ColiÅ¿ceo, which are proportioned according to the principall, together with their Caracters whereunto they are likened.</p>

And thirdly, there followeth the Orthographie of a pÃ©ece of the Å¿ayd Amphitheater without, which is all wrought after the ruÅ¿ticall manner, with Å¿tones of Verona, being very hard: but the Cornices are Å¿omewhat better made: which Cornices haue diuers and Å¿euerall Formes of the Romanes, and are very like vnto the Cornices of the Amphitheater of Pola.

This, and many other things, men may belÃ©eue, if we conÅ¿ider the great magnificence of the Romanes, in the Antiquities of Verona. There are yet vpon the great Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer of Adixe two fayre ancient Bridges, betwÃ©ene the which two Bridges, there was a moÅ¿t fayre and notable Spectaele, whereon there might Å¿tand a great number of people, to behold the Playes and Å¿ports there made in Boates, vpon the water: which Spectacle was made along by the water Å¿ide, againÅ¿t a hill: and higher vpwards, aboue this Spectacle, there was a Theater, the Scene whereof, and the Spectacle ioyned together: (and for that, as I Å¿ayd before, the Theater was made very artificially in the hill, Å¿o is it aboue the Theater in the height of the hill) there was a great building, which Å¿urpaÅ¿Å¿ed all the other: but the ruines of theÅ¿e buildings are Å¿o many, and Å¿o caÅ¿t downe in proceÅ¿Å¿e of time, that it would be great charges and loÅ¿Å¿e of tune to find them out: but for that in many places of the hill I haue Å¿Ã©ne Å¿ome parts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, therefore it makes me wonder thereat.

And this is touching the Orthographie of the Amphitheater, the which Orthographie is on the next Å¿ide, marked <hi>P.</hi> and for that (as in the Treaty of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Ichnographia I haue Å¿ayd) the Amphitheater hath Å¿ome PilaÅ¿ters on foure Å¿ides, which were made for Å¿trengthening &amp; counterforting of the walls: the which wall Å¿tood within, without any thing elÅ¿e; and therefore I meane to Å¿hew how it Å¿tood: the Figure marked <hi>Q.</hi> Å¿heweth the Å¿ides of this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfort: &amp; that part marked <hi>H.</hi> repreÅ¿enteth a PilaÅ¿ter: that part marked <hi>I.</hi> Å¿heweth the Profill of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wall of the Amphithe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ater: betwÃ©ene the PilaÅ¿ter <hi>H.</hi> and the wall or PilaÅ¿ter marked <hi>I.</hi> is a going through of three foot and an halfe wide: Å¿o that two men may goe through together.

And that the Cornices of this preÅ¿ent Building may be the better vnderÅ¿tood, therefore I haue Å¿et them there beÅ¿ides in greater forme, that a man may know their members, by their Caracters or Letters which they are marked withal. The manner of this Cornicement is much different fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> the RomiÅ¿h, as men may Å¿Ã©e: and I, for my part, would not make Å¿uch Cornices in my worke; but with the Theater of this Towne, I would Å¿erue my turne, becauÅ¿e they are of a better manner of worke. I am of opinion, that this was an other workeman, different from the other, and it may be that this workeman was a high Almaine, becauÅ¿e the Cornices are made much after the Dutch manner.</p>

Many belÃ©eue that this Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramides was a Sepulchre: for that within it, there is a place in the middle, whereon lyeth a great Å¿tone: thereupon men preÅ¿ume, that Å¿ome great perÅ¿on hath there bÃ©ene buried: but going in, vpon the left hand, you find a going vp of Å¿tone, which turnes about the Piramides within, through the which you goe vp the Station, in the top within. About the middle of this Piramides there is another going in, but it is faÅ¿t Å¿hut: on the top of this Piramides, there is a faire flat or playne, about <hi>8.</hi> Paces broad on euery Å¿ide, whereby workemen know, that it was the Å¿ame playne that was made at the finiÅ¿hing of the Piramides. Not farre from thence, there is a head of hard Å¿tone, with part of the breÅ¿t all of one Å¿tone; the face whereof is <hi>10</hi> Paces long: and in this Figure there are Å¿ome Egyptian letters: of this Pirami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des and head, <hi>Peter Martir</hi> writeth, and hath alÅ¿o Å¿Ã©ene and meaÅ¿ured them, which differ not much.</p>

The Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traue hereof pleaÅ¿eth mee well inough. The two members marked <hi>C.</hi> Å¿hew the Facie and the Profill of the MenÅ¿ola, which is the cloÅ¿ing Å¿tone of the Arch. The members marked with <hi>E.</hi> are, in truth, rich for worke, but yet Å¿o rich, that the one darkeneth the other: but if the parts were Å¿o deuided, that the one were grauen, and the other playne, I would commend it more. And herein the workeman that made the Pantheon, was very iudicious, for that you Å¿Ã©e no Å¿uch confuÅ¿ion in his Ornaments. The worke vnder this Arch is very well made and deuided; it is alÅ¿o a fayre Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment, and rich of worke. But it may be, that Å¿uch as are too much conceited to commend Antiquities of Rome, will (peraduenture) thinke that I am too bold to cenÅ¿ure vpon that which hath bÃ©ene made by Å¿uch Å¿kilfull ancient Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes; but in this reÅ¿pect. I would haue them take my Å¿pÃ©eches in good part, for that all my intent is, to Å¿hew it them that know it not, and Å¿uch as will Å¿ubiect themÅ¿elues to heare my opinion: for it is not Å¿ufficient to make ancient things as they Å¿tand, but it is another thing with <hi>Vitruuius</hi> aduice to chuÅ¿e out the beÅ¿t and fayreÅ¿t, and to reiect the worÅ¿e. It is true, that the chiefeÅ¿t part of an Architector is, that hee miÅ¿taketh not himÅ¿elfe in giuing his cenÅ¿ure, as many doe, who being obÅ¿tinate in their opinions, make all things as they haue Å¿Ã©ene them, and hereby couer their vnÅ¿kilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e, without giuing any other reaÅ¿ons of things: and there are Å¿ome that Å¿ay, <hi>Vitruuius</hi> was but a man, and that they alÅ¿o are men Å¿ufficient, to make and inuent new things, without regarding, that <hi>Vitruuius</hi> confeÅ¿Å¿eth to haue learned it from Å¿o many Å¿kilfull men, partly in his owne time, as alÅ¿o by meanes of the writing of other work men.</p>

There is no meaÅ¿ure of the BaÅ¿e of the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deÅ¿tals; but it may be thought, that they containe as much at the leaÅ¿t, as the Cornice of the PedeÅ¿tals: which Cornice is a Palme, and Å¿o much the BaÅ¿e may hold: of which part, the forme Å¿tandeth heere in the middle, marked <hi>G.</hi> The BaÅ¿e of the Columne Å¿tandeth thereby marked <hi>F.</hi> the which BaÅ¿e hath a Å¿tone or counter-BaÅ¿e vnder the Plinthus: and this may peraduenture be done, becauÅ¿e the Columnes could not reach to Å¿uch a height as they Å¿hould.

And firÅ¿t, the BaÅ¿e marked <hi>F.</hi> is of the PedeÅ¿tall of the Å¿aid Arch: the height whereof, is a Palme and <hi>30.</hi> minutes. The height of the Plinthus vnder the BaÅ¿e is <hi>28.</hi> minutes: the reÅ¿t of the parts are meaÅ¿urably deuided, and proportioned accordingly. The height of the Cornices of the PedeÅ¿tall, which Å¿tand marked vnder the BaÅ¿e <hi>E.</hi> is <hi>42.</hi> minutes, and is alÅ¿o proportioned according to the principall. The counter-BaÅ¿e, vnder the BaÅ¿e of the Columnes (which I thinke were placed there accidentally) to heighten the Columnes, is <hi>32.</hi> minutes high: the whole height of this BaÅ¿e of the Columnes, is <hi>53.</hi> minutes: touching the height of the Columnes, I Å¿pake before, and alÅ¿o of the Capitals; of which Capitals, the forme Å¿tandeth not here, for that the like doth Å¿tand in my fourth Booke, of the Order of CompoÅ¿ita: the height of the Architraues, FrÃ©eÅ¿es and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nices, is alÅ¿o Å¿poken of before: and this Cornice is very Å¿Ã©emely, for that there is no licenciouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e in it, which is in Å¿ome other BaÅ¿es of this Arch; as it is in the impoÅ¿t of the middlemoÅ¿t Arch, marked <hi>C.</hi> the which impoÅ¿t is greater and of more members and parts, then the great and principall Cornice, and is altogether confuÅ¿ed in members, and that which is moÅ¿t intolerable, the Dentiles and Mutiles are one aboue the other: and although the Dentiles were not there, yet there nÃ©eded not Å¿uch a Cornice to beare vp an Arch. Herein the workeman of the Theater of <hi>Marcellus</hi> was more cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumÅ¿pect then this: for the impoÅ¿ts of the Arches of the Å¿aid Theater, are the fayreÅ¿t and beÅ¿t of Å¿hew for impoÅ¿ts that euer I Å¿aw, and Å¿uch, as from the which a man may learne to make the like. The impoÅ¿t of the leÅ¿Å¿er Arches marked <hi>D.</hi> is one Palme and <hi>23.</hi> minutes and an halfe high: the which impoÅ¿t would Å¿tand much better, if the two flats betwÃ©ene the AÅ¿tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall aboue, and the Echine vnder, were turned into playnneÅ¿Å¿e only; which then would Å¿erue for an Abacus, or alÅ¿o for a crowne, hauing the due Proiecture. The BaÅ¿e vnder the Å¿econd Å¿tory marked <hi>A.</hi> is <hi>16.</hi> minutes high: the height of the vppermoÅ¿t Cornice, is <hi>43.</hi> minutes, which height Å¿hould bee too little in Å¿o great a diÅ¿tance, if it were not that the great Proiecture or Gallery, or ouerhanging holpe it not; becauÅ¿e they are Å¿eeing vpwards, from vnderneath, which Å¿heweth it to be much greater then it is: therefore I much commend this Cornice in this reÅ¿pect. And truely, all the Cornices, whereof the crowne hath more proiecture then height, anÅ¿were alwayes better, and may be made thinner of Å¿tone, Å¿o that the members of the building endure leÅ¿Å¿e wayght: neuertheleÅ¿Å¿e, you muÅ¿t not make them of too many licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious proiectures: but you Å¿hall read hereof in <hi>Vitruuius,</hi> where he entreateth of the Order of crownes, after the maner of Ionica and Dorica: for he doeth there teach you clearely inough.</p>

This faire Arch, as it is conceyued, <hi>Nerua Traianus</hi> cauÅ¿ed to be builded: whereupon, in the higheÅ¿t part of the Arch (as it is Å¿ayd) his Image was erected, Å¿itting on horÅ¿e backe, Å¿Ã©eming to threaten Å¿he clouds and people, ouer whom he looked and gouerned, leÅ¿t they Å¿hould rebell againe: which Image was of Copper excellently well made. There were alÅ¿o betwÃ©ene the Columnes, aboue the Cornices, certaine Images of Copper, as the letters in thoÅ¿e pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces written, doe Å¿hew: there are alÅ¿o tokens of holes, which Å¿hewes that there were Kings of Copper, or other Å¿uch like things hanging in them, which might bee taken from the Eothes, Vandals, or other enemies.

The wideneÅ¿Å¿e of the Arch is ten foote: the thickeneÅ¿Å¿e inwards is nine foote and two minutes: the thickneÅ¿Å¿e of the Columnes is two foote, <hi>11.</hi> minutes: the Intercolumnes, for Å¿paces betwÃ©ene the Columnes, is <hi>7.</hi> foote, <hi>5.</hi> minutes: the Columnes Å¿tand without the wall, <hi>1.</hi> foote and <hi>11.</hi> minutes: the height of the Arch is <hi>25.</hi> foot and <hi>1.</hi> third part: and this height, although it holdeth more then two foure Å¿quares, is not therefore miÅ¿Å¿hapen, when you behold the whole maÅ¿Å¿e together: the height of the PedeÅ¿tals with all their Cornices, is <hi>5.</hi> foote: the breadth is thrÃ©e foote, <hi>15.</hi> minutes and a halfe: the height of the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿es of the Columnes, together with the VnderbaÅ¿es are <hi>1.</hi> foote and <hi>36.</hi> minutes: the height of the Columnes to the Capitals, is <hi>19.</hi> foote, <hi>22.</hi> minutes and a halfe: the thickneÅ¿Å¿e vnder the Capitall is one foote and <hi>56.</hi> minutes: the height of the Capitall is <hi>2.</hi> foote, <hi>24.</hi> minutes, with the Abacus; and the Abacus is <hi>10.</hi> minutes: the Å¿ayd Capitall you Å¿hall find in my fourth Booke, in the beginning of the order of Corinthia: the height of the Architraue is one foote and <hi>12.</hi> minutes: the height of the Freefe is one foote and <hi>18.</hi> minutes: the height of the Cornice is <hi>1.</hi> foote and <hi>22.</hi> mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes: the height of the Plinthus aboue the Cornice, is one foote, <hi>6.</hi> minutes and a halfe: the height of the BaÅ¿e aboue the Å¿ayd Plinthus, is <hi>30.</hi> minutes: the height of the Epitaph vnder the Cornice, is <hi>6.</hi> foote and <hi>22.</hi> minutes; but the Cornice aboue it was not meaÅ¿ured.</p>

                        <p>IN my opinion, I haue Å¿ayd enough of the meaÅ¿ure of the Arch of <hi>Ancona,</hi> yet that the parts of the Cornices may be the better vnderÅ¿tood, I will Å¿hew them here greater: and firÅ¿t, I will Å¿et downe the loweÅ¿t parts, as they Å¿tand aboue the ground of the worke. The height of the PedeÅ¿tall, marked <hi>G.</hi> is Å¿ayd to be of <hi>5.</hi> foot, with all the Cornices there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: but the height of the Plinthus of the BaÅ¿e, is <hi>18.</hi> minutes: the BaÅ¿e aboue the Plinthus, is <hi>19.</hi> minutes, and a third part high: the Cornice of the PedeÅ¿tall, is <hi>20.</hi> minutes, and a third part high; Å¿o much doeth the Å¿tone alÅ¿o hold, Å¿tanding thereby, marked <hi>F.</hi> which, by my aduice, is placed there, to heighten the Columnes, and Å¿heweth not badly, but more, becauÅ¿e it is Å¿et forth with a liÅ¿t round about it; whereby the BaÅ¿e differeth from the Plinthus: and Å¿o, in my opinion, Å¿tandeth well. The BaÅ¿e, which is Corinthia, together with the Cincte of the Columne, is <hi>43.</hi> minutes high: and the Proiecture, is <hi>16.</hi> minutes and an halfe in bredth: the thickneÅ¿Å¿e of the PedeÅ¿tall, is <hi>3.</hi> foote, <hi>15.</hi> minutes and an halfe: the thickneÅ¿Å¿e of the Columne, is <hi>2.</hi> foote, <hi>11.</hi> minutes: and there Å¿tand <hi>13.</hi> hollowings, or chanels, without the PilaÅ¿ter: the wideneÅ¿Å¿e of one chanell, is <hi>7.</hi> minutes and a halfe: and the LiÅ¿t which parteth them, is <hi>2.</hi> minutes and a halfe. The height of the Capitals are the thickneÅ¿Å¿e of the Columnes below, without the Abacus: which Capitall hath a very fayre forme, whereby we may be perÅ¿waded and beleeue, that <hi>Vitruuius</hi> doctrine is falÅ¿e, and that <hi>Vitruui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> vnderÅ¿tood the height of the Capitall without Abacus: (and for this cauÅ¿e) for that the moÅ¿t part of the Capitals that I haue Å¿Ã©ene and meaÅ¿ured, are moÅ¿t of Å¿uch height, and higher, and Å¿pecially the Capitals that Å¿tand in the Rotund: whereof, in the beginning of this Booke you may Å¿Ã©e one. The height of the Architraue aboue the Columne, is one foote and twelue minutes. The height of the FrÃ©eÅ¿e, is one foote and eyghtÃ©ene minutes. The height of the Cornice, is one foote and two and twenty minutes. TheÅ¿e thrÃ©e are marked together with an <hi>A.</hi> The Plinthus aboue the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice is one foote, Å¿ixe minutes and an halfe high: The BaÅ¿e vpon it, is thirtie minutes: the Å¿pace wherein the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are written, is Å¿ire foote and two and twenty minutes, and is marked with <g ref="char:cross">â</g>. The ImpoÅ¿t of the Arch is marked <hi>D.</hi> the height whereof is <hi>1.</hi> foote and fiftÃ©ene minutes: but the vppermoÅ¿t Cornice, as I haue Å¿ayd, was not meaÅ¿ured. The height of the MenÅ¿ole in place of the cloÅ¿ing Å¿tone, marked <hi>B.</hi> aboue the Arch, is thrÃ©e foot and <hi>30.</hi> minutes: and hath a foote and <hi>14.</hi> minutes without the wall, in the vppermoÅ¿t part; and in the parts below, it comes out a foot. The foure tables with the Cornices vpon them, which Å¿tand betwÃ©ene the Columnes, are thought to be placed there, for hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vp of halfe Images: the forme whereof, Å¿tandeth here marked <hi>E.</hi> and is there alÅ¿o by the Profill on the Å¿ide, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by a man may Å¿Ã©e how they are wrought: for they are full of worke, euen to the Center. The height of the Cornices, Å¿tanding aboue them, is <hi>32.</hi> minutes: and although I haue not Å¿hewed all the Proiectures &amp; heights from part to part, yet I haue with great diligence reduced them from the great, into a Å¿mall forme, and were (as I Å¿ayd before of the reÅ¿t) meaÅ¿ured with the old Romane foot.</p>

                        <p>THe Towne of <hi>Pola</hi> in <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> is adorned with many Antiquities: beÅ¿ides the Theater &amp; Amphitheater, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I Å¿pake before, there are other Buildings, whereof now I will Å¿peake. There is an Arch Tryumphant, of Corinthia worke, rich of ornaments, for Figures, works, and Å¿trange deuices; Å¿o that from the PedeÅ¿tal vpwards, there is no worke nor Å¿pace leÅ¿t vngrauen, not onely before, but alÅ¿o on the Å¿ides, and within, and vnder in the Arch, wherein are many and diuers works, Å¿o that it would require long time to declare them particularly: therefore I will Å¿hew Å¿uch parts thereof as are neceÅ¿Å¿ary for a workeman, for inuention and Arte. The ground of the Arch following Å¿tandeth hereunder, meaÅ¿ured with a Moderne or common foote, whereof the halfe is here Å¿et downe. The Arch is <hi>12.</hi> foot and a halfe wide: the height is about <hi>21.</hi> foot. The PilaÅ¿ters in the Å¿ides inward are <hi>4.</hi> foot thicke. The thicknes of a Columne is one foote, <hi>9.</hi> ounces and a halfe. The Intercolumne is <hi>2.</hi> foot, <hi>3.</hi> ounces and a halfe. The PilaÅ¿ter of the Arch is one foot, <hi>2.</hi> ounces broad. The height of the Plinthus vnder the BaÅ¿e of the PedeÅ¿tall, is one foote. The BaÅ¿e is <hi>4.</hi> ounces high. The flat of the PedeÅ¿tall is <hi>3.</hi> foot: the Cornice <hi>4.</hi> ounces. The Plinthus marked <hi>D.</hi> vnder the Columnes is <hi>4.</hi> ounces. The height of the BaÅ¿e with the Plinthus is <hi>10.</hi> ounces and one quarter. The height of the Columne is <hi>16.</hi> foote, one ounce and <hi>3.</hi> quarters. The height of the Capitall is <hi>2.</hi> foot and one ounce. The height of the Architraue is one foote and one ounce. The height of the FrÃ©eÅ¿e is one foote and <hi>2.</hi> ounces.

The height of the BaÅ¿e of the PedeÅ¿tall, and alÅ¿o of the Plinthus vpon it, is one foote and <hi>2.</hi> ounces: but the height of the BaÅ¿e alone is <hi>10.</hi> ounces. The height of the flat of the PedeÅ¿tall is <hi>2.</hi> foote and one ounce. The Cornice is <hi>6.</hi> ounces.

                        <p>IN the Å¿ide before, I haue Å¿poken of the vniuerÅ¿all meaÅ¿ure of the Arch triumphant of <hi>Pola,</hi> and haue alÅ¿o Å¿hewed the Figure thereof, and partly Å¿et downe Å¿ome of the richeÅ¿t and faireÅ¿t ornaments of the Å¿ame: Now I will Å¿et downe the particular meaÅ¿ures of the parts thereof: and firÅ¿t, I will begin with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> nether parts, as that was placed firÅ¿t aboue the ground. The height of the Plinthus vnder the BaÅ¿e of the PedeÅ¿tall, is one foot; although that vnder it there lieth another of much more height, but it is vnder the earth: the height of the Cimatie turned about aboue it, with the AÅ¿tragalus, is <hi>4.</hi> ounces: the flat of the PedeÅ¿tall, is <hi>3.</hi> foot high: the Cimatie aboue, it is <hi>4.</hi> ounces, &amp; Å¿o much alÅ¿o is the vnder-BaÅ¿e, aboue the Cimatie: the height of the BaÅ¿e of the Columnes, is <hi>10.</hi> ounces, and is very well cut and grauen: and although the forme is Dorica, yet the delicate works thereof Å¿hew that it is Corinthia: the Columnes are fluited or chaneled from the top to the bottom; and there are alÅ¿o many hollowings without the PilaÅ¿ter, as the Figure hereafter doeth Å¿hew. The height of the Capitall with the Abacus, is two foote and one ounce: the which Capitall is higher then the thickneÅ¿Å¿e of the Columne beneath. NeuertheleÅ¿Å¿e, it is very well, and Å¿heweth pleaÅ¿ing to Å¿ight; it is alÅ¿o richly wrought, as it is here Å¿hewed in the Figure thereof: and alwayes, as the Capitall of Corinthia is in Å¿uch proportion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainÅ¿t the Columne, I would thinke it better to the view of workemen; then if with the Abacus it had but the height of the Diameter of the Columne: and although <hi>Vitruuius</hi> writeth thus (as is before Å¿ayd) yet may his text be falÅ¿ified. The height of the Architraue, is one foot and one ounce: the height of the FrÃ©eÅ¿e, is one foote and two ounces: the height of the Cornice, is a foote and ten ounces: which Cornice is very licencions, although it be rich of worke, becauÅ¿e Å¿uch rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e of worke confoundeth it: but that which is moÅ¿t vnÅ¿Ã©emely in it, is the Echine with the Ouale aboue the Seima, a thing, in trueth, much vnÅ¿ightly: and that, which is more worthy laughter, is, that the Å¿aid Echine in the vpper part, is cut through, without being couered with any liÅ¿t, that it might not bee conÅ¿umed with the water. But there hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes bÃ©ene licencious workemen, as there are yet in our dayes, who, to pleaÅ¿e the people, make much grauing in their workes, without reÅ¿pecting the qualities of the orders, and will alÅ¿o in Dorica worke, which Å¿hould bee faÅ¿t and Å¿trong, vÅ¿e much grauing and cutting, as in Corinthia worke, which, by their folly, aÅ¿keth many ornaments. But wiÅ¿e and iudicious workemen will alwayes obÅ¿erue Decorum: and if they make worke after Dorica maner, they will follow good Antiquities: which, for the moÅ¿t part, agrÃ©e with <hi>Vitruuius</hi> precepts. If they make any worke after the Corinthia maner, then they couer them with Ornaments, as that kind of worke requireth. This I haue Å¿et downe, to aduertiÅ¿e thoÅ¿e thereof that know it not; for they that know it, nÃ©ede not my aduice. Now to come to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿e agayne: Aboue this Cornice there is a BaÅ¿ement, which maketh out thrÃ©e PedeÅ¿tals; the Plinthus vnder the BaÅ¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which is there Å¿et againÅ¿t the proiecture of the Cornices, (for otherwiÅ¿e, in looking vp, it would darken the BaÅ¿e) is a foot high; aboue it Å¿tandeth the BaÅ¿e, whereof the height is <hi>10.</hi> ounces: the flat of the BaÅ¿ement, is <hi>2.</hi> foot &amp; <hi>1.</hi> ounce high: the Cornice aboue it, is halfe a foote high; which Cornice is very Å¿eemely, and the parts thereof deuide themÅ¿elues very well from each other, for that betwÃ©ene the two carued members there Å¿tandeth one playne aboue: the Cornice is that member or part, called <hi>Corona liÅ¿is,</hi> as I vnderÅ¿tand <hi>Vitruuius,</hi> whereof the height is <hi>5.</hi> ounces. Aboue theÅ¿e there are Å¿ome Å¿tones that Å¿hew to no end at all, but it may be thought, that Å¿ome things Å¿toode vpon them: the height of theÅ¿e Å¿tones is <hi>10.</hi> ounces: the height of the ImpoÅ¿t of this Arch is <hi>10.</hi> ounces; the which ImpoÅ¿t is very licenciouÅ¿ly made: and although thoÅ¿e <hi>3.</hi> members one aboue the other, are diuers, yet they are like each other in proiecture: and therefore in the worke they Å¿tand to no good effect: the other parts you Å¿hall know by the Caracters in the great Arch.</p>

                        <p>IN <hi>Verona,</hi> there are many tryumphant Arches; among the reÅ¿t, there is one Gate, called <hi>CaÅ¿tel Vecchio:</hi> the which, truely, is of good proportion: this Arch, as men conceaue, was wrought both before and behind, and alÅ¿o on the Å¿ides: it had two goings in, as you may perceaue by the ground which is yet Å¿Ã©ene, although I Å¿hewed but one Å¿ide onely. This building was meaÅ¿ured by the Å¿ame foot, wherewith the Arch of <hi>Pola</hi> aforeÅ¿ayd was meaÅ¿ured. The widenes of this Arch is ten foote and an halfe: the thickneÅ¿Å¿e of the Columnes, is two foot and two ounces: the intercolumnes, are <hi>4.</hi> foot and <hi>3.</hi> ounces: the PilaÅ¿ter or Pillar of the Arch, is <hi>2.</hi> foote and <hi>2.</hi> ounces broad. The thickeneÅ¿Å¿e of the Arch in the Å¿ides inward, is <hi>4.</hi> foot and an halfe: the wideneÅ¿Å¿e of the Tabernacle betwÃ©ene the Columnes, is two foot and ten ounces: and thus much for the wideneÅ¿Å¿e and thickeneÅ¿Å¿e: but comming to the height, the BaÅ¿e of the PedeÅ¿tall of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnes, together with the Plinthus, is one foote and thrÃ©e ounces high: the flat of the PedeÅ¿tall, is foure foot, thrÃ©e ounces and an halfe: the Cornice is ten ounces and an halfe: the height of the BaÅ¿e of the Columnes, is one foot: the height of the body of the Columne, without BaÅ¿e or Capitall, is <hi>17.</hi> foote and thrÃ©e ounces: the height of the Capitall, is two foot, foure ounces and an halfe. The height of the Architraue, is one foot and an halfe: the height of the FrÃ©eÅ¿e is one foote, <hi>7.</hi> ounces and an halfe: the height of the Cornice, is one foot and ten ounces: and although that in this Figure there is the FrontiÅ¿pice, yet you Å¿Ã©e it not in the Arch; for from the firÅ¿t Cornice vpwards there is nothing at all: neuertheleÅ¿Å¿e, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the wall is this yÃ©ere conÅ¿umed<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> yet you may Å¿Ã©e there Å¿ome Å¿ignes, whereby a man may conceaue that the Fronti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿pice hath bÃ©ene there. The vppermoÅ¿t Cornice is not there, and therefore I Å¿et no meaÅ¿ures, according to all Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: but I haue made one, with Å¿uch meaÅ¿ure and formes, as my Å¿elfe would haue made it, hauing for a common rule, that the vppermoÅ¿t things Å¿tand the fourth part leÅ¿Å¿e, then the nethermoÅ¿t: this Cornice therefore, Å¿hall be the fourth part leÅ¿Å¿e then that which Å¿tandeth vnder it, and is thus deuided, that the whole height Å¿hould be Å¿et in foure parts and an halfe: the halfe part Å¿hall be for the AÅ¿tragal with the liÅ¿t, and the fourth part Å¿halbe for the Scima. The Proiecture muÅ¿t be like the height, &amp; Å¿o Å¿hall this vppermoÅ¿t Cornice be made in maner aforeÅ¿aid. BetwÃ©ene the Columnes Å¿tand Tabernacles, wherein there were Images, whereof the wideneÅ¿Å¿e is two foot and ten ounces: the height is Å¿euen foote, and the depth thereof in the wal, is one foote and ten ounces: the height of their BaÅ¿ement, is <hi>4.</hi> foot, with the BaÅ¿e and Scima: the little Pillars on eyther Å¿ide, are halfe a foot thicke: the Architraue is <hi>7.</hi> ounces and an halfe: the FrÃ©eÅ¿e is <hi>6.</hi> ounces high: the height of the Cornice without the Scima is <hi>4.</hi> ounces: the height of the Timpanum of the FrontiÅ¿pice, is <hi>8.</hi> ounces. Aboue theÅ¿e Tabernacles are Å¿mall tablets with other Cornices: the which tablets are two foot broad, and hold one foot in height: the height of each Cornice is <hi>11.</hi> ounces: the height of the openneÅ¿Å¿e of the Arch, although it be Å¿omewhat dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

This Arch tryumphant (by that which is found written within the inner parts thereof) by Å¿ome is Å¿ayd, that <hi>Vitruuius</hi> cauÅ¿ed it to be made: but I beleeue it not, and that for two reaÅ¿ons or cauÅ¿es. FirÅ¿t, that I Å¿ee not in the InÅ¿cription, that it Å¿aith, <hi>Vitruuius Polio:</hi> but it is poÅ¿Å¿ible that it was another <hi>Vitruuius</hi> that cauÅ¿ed it to be made. The Å¿econd reaÅ¿on is this, that <hi>Vitruuius Polio,</hi> in his writing of Architecture, doeth vtterly condemne and reiect Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles and Dentiles, Å¿tanding together in one Cornice, and Å¿uch a Cornice is found in this Arch.

The height of the BaÅ¿e abous vpon it, is <hi>6.</hi> ounces. The flat of the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deÅ¿tall, marked <hi>F.</hi> is <hi>4.</hi> foot, <hi>3.</hi> ounces and an halfe high. The Cornice vpon it, is <hi>10.</hi> ounces and an halfe high. The BaÅ¿e of the Columne, is one foote high. The Plinthus of this BaÅ¿e turneth into a <hi>Corona liÅ¿is;</hi> which me thinkes, is very pleaÅ¿ant: for that I haue two Å¿ome GrÃ©eke PedeÅ¿tals Å¿o. The Columne is Å¿trycked, chanelled or hollowed, from the toy to the bottom. The height of the Capitall of this Columne, is one foot, <hi>4.</hi> ounces and an halfe: but the forme is not here, becauÅ¿e it is Å¿hewed in the beginning of the Order of CompoÅ¿ita: which Capitall, in effect, is CompoÅ¿ita, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Arch may be wholly accompted to bee Corinthia: and this Capitall Å¿tandeth in that place, maked <hi>C.</hi> AlÅ¿o, in the Å¿ame place you Å¿ee the Capitall of the impoÅ¿t of the Arch, which is marked with <hi>D.</hi> But the little Capitall of the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle betweene the Columnes, is here marked <hi>H.</hi> And the Cornice alÅ¿o, with the EaÅ¿e, marked <hi>E.</hi> is that which is vnder the Tabernacle.

The Figure marked with <hi>B.</hi> is the worke which goeth about the Arch: the Cornice marked <hi>A.</hi> is the principall Cornice aboue the Arch; the which, in effect, is very comely, and well wrought: yet it is vicious, as I haue often Å¿ayd; that is, the Mutiles and the Dentiles therein are by <hi>Vitruuius</hi> reiected, with many Å¿trong reaÅ¿ons. But in this, many men affirme, that fithence <hi>Vitruuius</hi> time, many workemen haue made Mutiles with Dentiles, in moÅ¿t places of <hi>Italy,</hi> and there round about, Å¿o that now there is no queÅ¿tion made thereof; but euery man hath libertie to make that in his worke which he findeth and Å¿Ã©eth in Antiquities: whereunto I anÅ¿were, that diÅ¿prouing the Å¿ame, they haue prooued their cauÅ¿e to be good. But if they will acknowledge <hi>Vitruuius</hi> for a learned Architector, as moÅ¿t workemen affirme, then (reading <hi>Vitruuius</hi> with good iudgement) they muÅ¿t confeÅ¿Å¿e and acknowledge, that they haue done amiÅ¿Å¿e therein.</p>

                        <p>IN Verena, at the Gate <hi>Dei Leoni,</hi> there is a Tryumphant Arch, with two like goings through, which I neuer Å¿aw in any other place beÅ¿ides, but many with <hi>3.</hi> Arches: which building, although it hath the figure of <hi>6.</hi> windowes, yet go they not through, neyther yet very dÃ©epe in the wall: whereby you may iudge, that Å¿ome round Images Å¿toode in them.

                        <p>HEre before, I Å¿pake of the vniuerÅ¿all meaÅ¿ure of the Å¿ayd Arch, and thereunto Å¿et downe the forme, according to the proportion of the Å¿ame, but cannot giue perfectly the particular parts in Å¿o Å¿mall a forme. Of which members, for that there are diuers ornaments in them, I will in this leaÅ¿e declare them: touching the height and thickneÅ¿Å¿e, I will Å¿peake no more; for I haue done it already: but I will onely Å¿hew which they are. The Figure marked <hi>G.</hi> is the firÅ¿t PedeÅ¿tall, with the BaÅ¿es, and the beginning of the Columnes, the which is hollowed: all the members are proportioned according to their greatneÅ¿Å¿e. The Capitall marked <hi>E.</hi> hauing the Architraue vpon it, followeth vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the firÅ¿t Columne, as the hollowing Å¿heweth. The Figure marked <hi>D.</hi> is the Architraue, FrÃ©eÅ¿e and Cornice toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which Å¿tand aboue the firÅ¿t Columne: which Cornice, by the authoritie and example, which is by me in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces alledged, the iudicious Reader may know, whether they be erroneous or good. The Capitall marked <hi>F.</hi> is that, which vpholdeth the Arch vpon the foureÅ¿quare Pillars; theÅ¿e two Capitals are called, Latine worke, and very fayre. I will not, as I haue Å¿aid, Å¿peake of the meaÅ¿ures, for that this Figure is proportioned after the principall, and with great diligence tranÅ¿ported from the great into the Å¿mall.</p>

                        <p>AS I Å¿ayd before, the Arch is very rich of ornaments, and among them, Å¿ome very fayre and perfect; Å¿ome alÅ¿o very vicious &amp; ill made: and in trueth, I finde nothing that more miÅ¿liketh me, then the Cornice marked <hi>D.</hi> in the other leaÅ¿e, for the reaÅ¿ons before Å¿hewed: but all the reÅ¿t before Å¿et downe are of good proportion, as well the workes as the Cornices. And as the parts of the firÅ¿t Å¿tory are, Å¿o are theÅ¿e following of the Å¿econd Å¿tory. The Mutiles marked <hi>H.</hi> are in the beginning of the Å¿econd Å¿tory aboue the FrontiÅ¿picie: vpon which Images (as I haue declared) there were Images faÅ¿tened againÅ¿t the flat PilaÅ¿ters. The window marked <hi>I.</hi> is the forme of one of the Windowes with the Cornice vpon it and therefore iuÅ¿t of his meaÅ¿ure. That Capitall and the BaÅ¿e marked <hi>K.</hi> is of the Å¿ame windowes, Å¿hewed in greateÅ¿t forme, that the members may be the better vnderÅ¿tood. That BaÅ¿e and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitall marked <hi>L.</hi> is the little Pillar betweene the PilaÅ¿ters and the window: and in trueth, in theÅ¿e two BaÅ¿es, that is, that of the greateÅ¿t of the Å¿mall Pillars ioyned with the leÅ¿Å¿er, the workeman was very iudicious to accord or agrÃ©e the one with the other, that the greateÅ¿t Pillar Å¿hould haue his due BaÅ¿e, and the leÅ¿Å¿er Å¿hould alÅ¿o haue a leÅ¿Å¿e BaÅ¿e, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to proportion, which I commend much. The Architraue, FrÃ©eÅ¿e and Cornice, marked <hi>C.</hi> Å¿heweth that of the Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Å¿tory, aboue the Å¿mall Pillars: this Cornice is very Å¿Ã©emely, and not confuÅ¿ed with cutting. The PedeÅ¿tall mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked <hi>B.</hi> Å¿heweth that of the laÅ¿t Å¿tory, whereof the BaÅ¿e marked <hi>M.</hi> doth reÅ¿t: alÅ¿o the Capitall which Å¿tandeth aboue, is his companion, and is truly Corinthia, the which is confirmed to the principall, for worke and faÅ¿hion, and in my o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, very Å¿Ã©emely. That Architraue, FrÃ©eÅ¿e, and Cornice, marked <hi>A.</hi> Å¿heweth the laÅ¿t Cornice: the Architraue is not vicious, becauÅ¿e it hath onely two Facies; for if it had thrÃ©e, it would, by the farre diÅ¿tance, Å¿tand cumbred: the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice with the Mutiles, liketh me well, becauÅ¿e it hath no Dentiles; and is alÅ¿o well deuided with members: neither is it confuÅ¿ed with much grauing, but hath a Å¿Ã©emely Proiecture, which heaueth vp the height thereof a little.</p>

The bredth of the Arches, is <hi>18.</hi> Palmes: and Å¿o much are the PilaÅ¿ters: the bredth of the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laÅ¿ters is deuided into <hi>11.</hi> parts: one part on eyther Å¿ide of the PilaÅ¿ter, which beareth the Arch Å¿hall haue, which is two parts: other two parts Å¿hall be giuen vnto one Columne, that is <hi>4.</hi> parts: <hi>2.</hi> parts Å¿hall be giuen to the little PilaÅ¿ters of the Niches, or hollow Å¿eates, and <hi>3.</hi> parts to the Niches themÅ¿elues: Å¿o are the <hi>11.</hi> parts diÅ¿tributed. The height of the PedeÅ¿tals Å¿hall be halfe the wideneÅ¿Å¿e of the PilaÅ¿ters. The height of the BaÅ¿e of the PedeÅ¿tals, Å¿hall haue one part of the before Å¿ayd <hi>11</hi> parts. The Cornice is the <hi>9.</hi> part leÅ¿Å¿e then the BaÅ¿e. The height of the Columnes, with BaÅ¿es and Capitals, are of <hi>9.</hi> Diameters, and thereunto alÅ¿o the Å¿euenth part. The BaÅ¿e is halfe the thickeneÅ¿Å¿e of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnes. The Capitall is of the Å¿ame thickeneÅ¿Å¿e: and the Å¿euenth part for the Abacus. The height of the Architraue, FrÃ©eÅ¿e and Cornice, is as much as the PedeÅ¿tall without his BaÅ¿e. And this height is deuided into <hi>11.</hi> parts, foure for the Architraue, <hi>3.</hi> for the FreeÅ¿e, becauÅ¿e it is vngrauen, and <hi>4.</hi> for the Cornice, as the halfe Circle of the Arch is drawne; then the heights of the lights will be double: after that, the impoÅ¿ts being drawne in their places, the which are of halfe a Columne thicke, and Å¿o the Niches or Å¿eates, and the Quadrans aboue them, haue their certaine proportion.</p>

                        <p>IN the leafe before, I Å¿hewed a piece of worke of <hi>Bramants</hi> making: and now I will Å¿hew another of his workes, from whence a wiÅ¿e workeman may helpe himÅ¿elfe much, by meanes of the diuers and Å¿undry ornaments that are in it. In this Gallery, the workeman would Å¿hew thrÃ©e Å¿tories or orders one aboue another, <hi>viz.</hi> Dorica, Ionica, and Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thia: and in trueth, the orders were faire, well Å¿et out, and placed: notwithÅ¿tanding, that the PilaÅ¿ters of the firÅ¿t Å¿tory or order being Dorica, were Å¿omewhat too weake, and the Arches too wide, to the proportion of the PilaÅ¿ters; and therewith the weight of the wall of the Ionica order Å¿tanding vpon it, was an occaÅ¿ion that it was broken, ruinated and decayed in Å¿hort time. But <hi>Balthazar</hi> of <hi>Sciene,</hi> a Å¿kilfull workeman, repayred the decayed ruines, making counter PilaÅ¿ters, with vnder-Arches: therefore I haue Å¿aid, wiÅ¿e workemen may learne of this building; not onely to imitate fayre and well made things, but alÅ¿o to beware of errors, and alwayes to conÅ¿ider what wright the nethermoÅ¿t Å¿tory is to Å¿uÅ¿taine: therefore I counÅ¿ell a workeman rather to be timerous, then ouer-bold; for if he be timerous, he will alwayes chuÅ¿e the Å¿ureÅ¿t way, and make his worke with conÅ¿ideration, and will vÅ¿e counÅ¿ell, yea of Å¿uch as are leÅ¿Å¿e Å¿kilfull then himÅ¿elfe, of whom Å¿ometime men often learne: but if he be high-minded, and truÅ¿teth too much to his own Å¿kill and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, then he will Å¿corne another mans counÅ¿ell, whereby oftentimes he deceyueth and ouer-Å¿hooteth himÅ¿elfe; Å¿o that oftentimes his worke falleth out badly. Now I will turne to Å¿peake of this Gallery, and Å¿et downe Å¿ome notes of the proportion thereof. The wideneÅ¿Å¿e of the Arch Å¿hall bee deuided into eyght parts, whereof thrÃ©e parts Å¿hall be for the bredth of the PilaÅ¿ters, and the height of the Arch Å¿hall containe <hi>16.</hi> of Å¿uch parts. The forepart of the PilaÅ¿ters Å¿hall be deuided into foure parts, whereof two parts Å¿hall be for the PilaÅ¿ters of the Arches, and the other two Å¿hall be for the thickneÅ¿Å¿e of the Columnes: the height of the PedeÅ¿tals Å¿hall containe halfe the wideneÅ¿Å¿e of the lights: the height of the Columnes Å¿hall bee eyght parts of their thickneÅ¿Å¿e, with the BaÅ¿es and Capitals. The height of the Architraue, FrÃ©eÅ¿e and Cornice, is a fourth part of the length of the Columne. The Å¿econd Å¿tory Å¿hall bee leÅ¿Å¿e then the firÅ¿t by a fourth part, <hi>viz.</hi> That from the Pauement of the Dorica Å¿tory, to the higheÅ¿t of the Cornice, Å¿hall be deuided into <hi>4.</hi> parts, and <hi>3.</hi> of them Å¿hall be for the whole Å¿tory of the Ionica worke, and Å¿o Å¿hall all the parts particularly bee leÅ¿Å¿ened in themÅ¿elues a fourth part. The like alÅ¿o Å¿hall be done with the third Å¿tory, which is Corinthia, in regard of the Å¿econd order, although it Å¿tandeth not here, becauÅ¿e the Figure is drawne too great: but not to put the Reader in a maze or doubt at the Columnes which Å¿tand here in the middle, as deÅ¿irous to know how they end at the top; you muÅ¿t vnderÅ¿tand, that you Å¿hall finde Å¿uch inuention in the fourth Booke, in the Order of Dorica in the Å¿ide <hi>H 2.</hi> that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though that thoÅ¿e Columnes are Ionica in the Å¿ayd Booke, notwithÅ¿tanding, you may make them Corinthia. And that the workeman might the better vnderÅ¿tand the members and Cornicements of this worke, I haue Å¿hewed them in grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter forme, and proportioned them according to the principall: I Å¿peake of the members of the firÅ¿t Å¿tory: for a man could not eaÅ¿ily come to meaÅ¿ure the other.</p>

I will not Å¿peake of the moÅ¿t beautifull Gardens, filled with all kind of flowres, with diuers compartements of the Orchards and TrÃ©es of all kind of Fruits, with great abundance of FiÅ¿h-ponds and FiÅ¿hes, of places and cages of diuers Birds both great and Å¿mall, of fayre Å¿tables, filled with all Å¿orts of HorÅ¿es; and of many other fayre things, which I will not Å¿peake of, for that <hi>Marcus Antonius Michaell,</hi> a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of that Towne, very learned in Architecture, hath Å¿Ã©ene it, and hath written of it at large in a Latine EpiÅ¿tle, which he Å¿ent to a friend of his. But to turne againe to the parts of the Å¿aid Palace, which is right foure Å¿quare, it is within, Galleried round about, one aboue the other: in the foure Corners, within the thickneÅ¿Å¿e of the walls, Å¿tand the winding Å¿tayres to goe vp into the building. The foure Galleries without, marked <hi>B.</hi> are not there, but for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie and beautifying of the houÅ¿e, they would Å¿tand well there.</p>

                        <p>COnÅ¿idering the fayre Building of Poggio Real, I haue thought good to Å¿et downe Å¿uch an other here in this place; but in other forme for appertements, and peraduenture with more eaÅ¿e, for that the places are all of one greatnes, which is not Å¿o good a forme: but it is neceÅ¿Å¿ary that the firÅ¿t Å¿hould be greater then the Å¿econd. In this place I make you no place for lights within, for that it is a place in the countrey, being not cumbred on the Å¿ides; it hath light inough on all the foure corners: but Å¿ome men may Å¿ay, that the Hall with the foure Chambers, becauÅ¿e they haue no light but through the galleries, are darke, for it is no perfect couer: to which I anÅ¿were, that the houÅ¿e being made to be vÅ¿ed in the time of great heat, hauing no place in the middle, the Hall and the Chambers will alwayes be cold, by reaÅ¿on the Sunne cannot come vnto them. TheÅ¿e places will be very pleaÅ¿ant at none time, for that the Å¿aid places haue not Å¿o great lights as the other dwellings; yet haue they Å¿o much light as they nÃ©ed: Å¿uch like may be Å¿Ã©ene in <hi>Bolonia,</hi> which are made in this manner with Galleries, and daily inhabited. This Building is Å¿o diÅ¿puÅ¿ed, that the corner places being of great thickeneÅ¿Å¿e, the reÅ¿t Å¿hall be Å¿trong inough, yea, although the walls had no great thickneÅ¿Å¿e, in regard they are all counterforts one to the other, yet Å¿hall they be of Å¿ufficient Å¿trength. I will not Å¿peake of the meaÅ¿ures, for that this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing proportioned, the Å¿kilful workman may imagine (according to his pleaÅ¿ure that cauÅ¿ed it to be built) firÅ¿t the greatnes of the roome, then deuide it into Å¿o many fÃ©et or other meaÅ¿ures, thereby to meaÅ¿ure all the reÅ¿t of the building, as the Å¿ituation of the place may beare it. Then this building, aboue all things, Å¿hall be placed, that the Sunne may riÅ¿e vpon one of the corners, and Å¿o Å¿hine vpon all the Å¿ides thereof: for if it Å¿tands with one Å¿ide to the EaÅ¿t, and the other to the WeÅ¿t, then it will follow, that the North Å¿ide Å¿hall neuer enioy the Sunne-Å¿hine vpon it, which were rumaticke and vn wholeÅ¿ome.</p>

                        <p>MEn may build in diuers and Å¿undry Å¿orts vpon the ground aforeÅ¿ayd: but for that this is a place of pleaÅ¿ure, I thought good, for the braueneÅ¿Å¿e thereof, to make it after the Corinthia maner. I will not trouble my Å¿elfe to Å¿peake of the meaÅ¿ures nor heights; for in my fourth Booke, in the Order of Corinthia, <hi>O 2.</hi> you Å¿hal find a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiÅ¿e, which, together with the iudgement of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wiÅ¿e workman, will Å¿erue to Å¿et down this meaÅ¿ure. And, for that in this Facie there is no Å¿hortening at all, whereby you may know the Galleries, the flat and cloÅ¿ed places eche from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; therefore I will Å¿et downe the two higheÅ¿t Å¿ides at eche end: you muÅ¿t conceaue it to haue flat Pillars from beneath vpwards; that part betwÃ©ene both, which is lower, you muÅ¿t Å¿uppoÅ¿e hath two Galleries, one aboue the other, the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnes whereof would be round: the Å¿ame is to be vnderÅ¿tood to be both behind, and on both Å¿ides. Men may alÅ¿o make aboue the Galleries a Tarrace or Pauement, to defend the raine, the Gallery being made with a Leane-to, or Raile, out of the Cornices of the firÅ¿t order of the Figures aforeÅ¿ayd: and Å¿o alÅ¿o the Hall in the middle, together with the <hi>4.</hi> Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Å¿econd Å¿tory, would haue more light. For <hi>2.</hi> cauÅ¿es I haue made the Å¿mall windows aboue the great, in the firÅ¿t Å¿tory. The <hi>1.</hi> is, if you will make the windowes Å¿o low, that a man Å¿itting, may eaÅ¿ily Å¿Ã©e out of them, then (if you Å¿hould make the windowes no higher then the doore) there would bee too much Å¿pace betwÃ©ene the windowes and the roofe of the houÅ¿e, which would greatly darken the houÅ¿e: and otherwyÅ¿e the windowes bring much more light into the Hall. The <hi>2.</hi> is, that the Chambers by the Hall nÃ©ed not bee of Å¿uch height, but you may make hanging Chambers therein, whereto thoÅ¿e windowes will Å¿erue. I might Å¿peake of many other things, which I referce to the iudgement of the workeman.</p>

                     <hi>VItruuius</hi> Å¿ayth, that Å¿uch as haue built without learning or inÅ¿truction (although workemen) could neuer make any famous or commendable pieces of worke: no more can others, being no workemen, Å¿uch as haue followed the letter or writing onely, and made no proofe: of which, Å¿ome haue preÅ¿umed to father their doings vpon <hi>Vitru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uius:</hi> yet in diuers places of their writings, which are found, they could not cloÅ¿e vp their rules orderly, but haue left ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things doubtfull, and (more) haue eÅ¿teemed that to be good and commendable, which in worke is not to bee endured. The cauÅ¿e of this errour, is, that the laÅ¿t Booke of the Å¿ayd <hi>Vitruuius,</hi> wherein the Figures are, was loÅ¿t: whereby men might haue knowne and Å¿ound out his meanings: Å¿o that hereby it appeareth, that Å¿ome Antiquities haue beene very bare in their workes, and eÅ¿pecially, in their Orders of Dorica, becauÅ¿e <hi>Vitruuius</hi> nameth no Dorica BaÅ¿es: but in Å¿tead thereof, Å¿peaketh of an Attica. Now it may be, regarding that he there Å¿peaketh not of any Order of Attica, therefore they durÅ¿t not make any Dorica BaÅ¿es or Columnes: on the contrary, others poÅ¿sibly contemning the darkneÅ¿Å¿e of the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, (or for want of knowledge) haue Å¿o far exceeded their Author in many things, that they haue not onely forÅ¿aken and left the examples and reaÅ¿ons of good Antiquities, but alÅ¿o (more then that) haue made their workes vnÅ¿eemely, and ridiculous to mens eyes, as may be Å¿eene in diuers antient works: whereby, gentle Reader, many workmen, well Å¿eene in both, haue beene cumbred therein, and eÅ¿pecially in this our time. <hi>Bramant</hi> of <hi>CaÅ¿tle Durant, Balthazar</hi> of <hi>Scienne,</hi> and many others, for that (not onely by meanes of <hi>Iulius</hi> the <hi>2.</hi> Pope, but) alÅ¿o by others good Architecture was bettered in their times: who, after long diÅ¿putation and Å¿earching of many, aÅ¿well Authors and Commentaries, together with the examples of good Antiquities, haue with authority (to make an end of all doubts) not only added this Spira Attica, of the Dorica, but alÅ¿o as many orders as now are vÅ¿ed, beginning at the ThuÅ¿can, as the groÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿t and Å¿lendereÅ¿t of all the reÅ¿t, and haue reduced the Å¿ame into a certaine and common forme, together with their ornaments and meaÅ¿ures: which vnles <hi>SebaÅ¿tian Serlius,</hi> a workeman and Å¿choler of the Å¿ayd <hi>Balthazar,</hi> hath written, and Å¿et out in figures; Å¿o that, leauing the obÅ¿curities of <hi>Vitruuius,</hi> we may make an incorrigible worke. And for that all thoÅ¿e that loue workemanÅ¿hip, vnderÅ¿tand not the Italians, therefore (in my opinion) I haue tranÅ¿lated the moÅ¿t certayne and beÅ¿t rules out of Italian into Dutch, and out of Dutch into EngliÅ¿h; onely the names of all Procels, BaÅ¿es, Capitals, Cornices, &amp;c. which are not named in Dutch nor EngliÅ¿h, for that <hi>BaÅ¿tian,</hi> by <hi>Vitruuius</hi> termes, vÅ¿eth the common and moderne Italian words, which by Å¿ome Å¿hould be as hardly vnderÅ¿tood as the Latine. But I would commend him, that Å¿eeing we take vpon vs to follow <hi>Vitruuius</hi> writings, that we giue him the name of <hi>Vitruuius,</hi> that the learned might bee vnderÅ¿tood of the workeman, and the workeman alÅ¿o vnderÅ¿tood of the learned. And for that the worke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man might the better read it, I haue printed it in our ordinary Dutch letter. And although this fourth Booke of Å¿euen was firÅ¿t Å¿et out, becauÅ¿e it is the beÅ¿t, yet the other alÅ¿o are no leÅ¿Å¿e fit and conuenient to further Architecture or Art of Building, as in the enÅ¿uing EpiÅ¿tle you Å¿hall Å¿ee.</p>

                  <p>In the third Booke, workmen Å¿hall Å¿ee the Ichnographie, that is, the ground: the Orthographie, that is, the rayÅ¿ing vp of a Building before.

                  <p>In the fourth, which is this, I will Å¿peake of fiue maner of Buildings, and of their ornaments, as ThuÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿cana, Dorica, Ionica, Corinthia and CompoÅ¿ita, that is to Å¿ay, mingled. And by theÅ¿e, the whole Arte is learned.</p>
                  <p>In the fift, I will Å¿peake of diuers kinds of Temples, Å¿et downe in diuers formes, that is, round, foure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿quare, Å¿ix-cornerd, eyght-cornerd, Ouall-wiÅ¿e, and croÅ¿Å¿e-wiÅ¿e, with their ground, heights and Å¿hortenings, diligently meaÅ¿ured.</p>
                  <p>In the Å¿ixt, I will Å¿peake of all dwellings, which, at this day, may bee vÅ¿ed, beginning at the meaneÅ¿t houÅ¿e or cotrage, and Å¿o from degree to degree, proceeding to the moÅ¿t rich, fayre and princely Palaces, as well in Countrie villages, as in great Cities or Townes.</p>

                  <p>Now then, to proceed readily herein, I will begin with the greateÅ¿t and ruÅ¿ticke order of Building, that is, the ThuÅ¿can, being the playneÅ¿t, rudeÅ¿t, and Å¿trongeÅ¿t, and of leaÅ¿t grace and Å¿eemelineÅ¿Å¿e.</p>

                  <p>THe ancient workemen in times paÅ¿t (as <hi>Vitruvius</hi> affirmeth) dedicated their workes and Buildings to the gods, according to their natures, Å¿trength or weakeneÅ¿Å¿e; Å¿o is the forme called Dorica aÅ¿cribed to the gods, <hi>Iupiter, Mars,</hi> and valiant <hi>Hercules,</hi> taking Å¿uch formes from Å¿trong men. The forme called Ionica, is aÅ¿cribed to the goddeÅ¿Å¿e <hi>Diana, Apollo</hi> and <hi>Bacchus,</hi> as of the nature of Matrons, that is, of wiÅ¿e &amp; Å¿enÅ¿ible women, which are both tender and Å¿trong: for <hi>Diana,</hi> by her femurine nature is tender, but by vÅ¿ing to hunt, Å¿hee is Å¿trong: <hi>Apollo,</hi> by reaÅ¿on of his beauty, is tender; but being a man, he is Å¿trong: the like of <hi>Bacchus.</hi> But the Corinthia is taken of ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â¢</desc>
                     </gap>ds, and they aÅ¿cribe all to the goddeÅ¿Å¿e <hi>VeÅ¿ta,</hi> and her chaÅ¿te mayds: yet at this time I thinke it good to procÃ©ed in another Å¿ort, nothing differing from the ancients afore Å¿ayd. My meaning is, to follow the maner and cuÅ¿tomes of the ChriÅ¿tians, that I (as far as I may) will aÅ¿cribe holy Buildings to God and to his Saints: and profane buildings, as well publicke as priuote, I will aÅ¿cribe to men according to their profeÅ¿Å¿ions. So Å¿ay I then, that the ThuÅ¿can maner (after my opinion) is fit for Å¿trengths, for Gates of Cities, Townes and CaÅ¿tles, places for treaÅ¿ure, munition and Artillery to kÃ©epe them in<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> for priÅ¿ons, hauens of the Sea, and Å¿uch like things, Å¿eruing for the warres. It is true, that ruÅ¿ticke and playns worke, that is, Å¿uch Buildings as are made of rough Å¿tones, and others that are made Å¿omewhat Å¿moother, according to the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ure which the Stone-cutters take therein, are Å¿ometimes mixed with Dorica, and Å¿ometimes with Dorica and Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thia. Neuertheles, for that the ThuÅ¿can order is the rougheÅ¿t Å¿et foorth, farre more then the other are, I am of opinion, that the Country Bulding is more like vnto the ThuÅ¿can, then any of the reÅ¿t: which you may playnely Å¿Ã©e to haue bÃ©ene obÅ¿erued by the ThuÅ¿cans, as wel in their chiefe Cities and Townes of <hi>Florence,</hi> as without in their Country Villages, in Å¿o many rich and fayre Buildings, made after the ruÅ¿ticall maner, as may be Å¿Ã©ene in all ChriÅ¿tendome, mixed with Å¿uch a Å¿light manner of worke, as the workeman thought good. Therefore I conclude, that Å¿uch Buildings are more agrÃ©eable to ThuÅ¿can order, then any other. Therefore, altering Å¿omewhat from Antiquities, and Å¿ome others of ours, I will in diuers Å¿orts Å¿hewe of Å¿uch workes, <hi>viz.</hi> how to make Gates of Cities, Townes, or Forts; as alÅ¿o, in publike and priuate places, HouÅ¿es, Galleries, Windowes, Niches or Å¿eates, hollowed in worke, Bridges, Water-courÅ¿es, and Å¿uch like Å¿euerall Ornaments, as may happen into a workemans hands to doe. Men may alÅ¿o (not differing from the ancient rules) mixe this ruÅ¿ticall maner with the Dorica, and alÅ¿o with Ionica; and Å¿ometimes with Corinthia, at the pleaÅ¿ure of thoÅ¿e that Å¿e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ke to pleaÅ¿e their owne fantaÅ¿ies, which a man may affirme to bee more for pleaÅ¿ure then profit: therefore the workeman ought to procÃ©ede with good aduice, eÅ¿pecially in publike buildings, wherein comelineÅ¿Å¿e is commendable.</p>
                  <p>In the beginning of this Booke, I obÅ¿erued the Comedians order, who (when they intend to play any Comedy) firÅ¿t Å¿end out a Prologue, who in few wordes giueth the audience to vnderÅ¿tand what they intend to entreat of, in their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie. So I, meaning in this Booke to entreat of fiue maner of Buildings, <hi>viz.</hi> ThuÅ¿can, Dorica, Ionica, Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thia and CompoÅ¿ita, haue thought good, that in the beginning thereof, men Å¿hould Å¿Ã©e the Figures of all the Å¿eueral kinds whereof I purpoÅ¿e to entreat of. And although that in the Columnes and their ornaments, all the meaÅ¿ures and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions are not Å¿et downe, but onely the principall, by generall rules; yet will I not fayle, as occaÅ¿ion Å¿hall Å¿erue, to Å¿et them downe in particularities: but this is done, as I Å¿ayde, to Å¿hew in generall rules for an Introduction onely, the better to be vnderÅ¿tood of euery workeman, and in the beginning will obÅ¿erue <hi>Vitruuius</hi> order and termes, marked on the Å¿ides with <hi>A. B. C.</hi> that euery workeman may name them according to his country Å¿pÃ©ech. And firÅ¿t, the Stilo bato, or ThuÅ¿can PedeÅ¿tall, I meane the flat, without Crowne or BaÅ¿e, Å¿hall bee a perfect foureÅ¿quare. The perfect Dorica Å¿hall be as much more as the drawing of a liue from corner to corner, of the perfect foureÅ¿quare, placing it vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right. The PedeÅ¿tall Ionica, Å¿hall be of one foureÅ¿quare and an halfe: the PedeÅ¿tall Corinthia, Å¿hall be a foureÅ¿quare and two third parts thereof. The PedeÅ¿tall CompoÅ¿ita Å¿hall bee of two perfect foureÅ¿quares. AlÅ¿o, wonder not, that the Chapter next enÅ¿uing is the fiÅ¿t, which others would eÅ¿tÃ©eme the firÅ¿t; for that the firÅ¿t Booke doeth contayn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>IN <hi>Vitruuius</hi> fourth Booke and Å¿euenth Chapter, we find, that a man Å¿hould make a ThuÅ¿can Columne of Å¿euen parts high, with Capitall and BaÅ¿e, which meaÅ¿ure Å¿hould be taken from the thickneÅ¿Å¿e of the Columne below. The height of the BaÅ¿es or BaÅ¿ement, Å¿hould be the halfe of the thickneÅ¿Å¿e of the Columne, which Å¿hall bee deuided into two equall parts, whereof one Å¿hall be the Plinthus, the other deuided in three, two parts thereof Å¿hall bee the Thorus, the third the Circle, The Proiecture you Å¿hall make in this maner: FirÅ¿t, make a Circle as great as the Columne is thicke below, placing it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>ãâã</desc>
                           </gap> a foureÅ¿quare: without the foureÅ¿quare drew another Circle, cloÅ¿e about the corners of the foureÅ¿quare, which Å¿hall bee the Proiecture. And although all other BaÅ¿es haue their Plinthus foureÅ¿quare, yet this of ThuÅ¿, can muÅ¿t beround, as <hi>Vitruuius</hi> teacheth. The height of the Capitall muÅ¿t bee like the BaÅ¿e: that deuide into three parts: one part Å¿hall be the Abacus: the other Å¿hall bedeuided in foure parts, three for the Echino, the fourth for the Annulo or Cintho, which may be called a Girdle, Band, or LiÅ¿t in EngliÅ¿h. The third part reÅ¿ting; Å¿hall bee for the Hypotrachalium, or FreeÅ¿e. The AÅ¿tragal with the Cincta, is halfe the FreeÅ¿e; but that deuided in three, two Å¿hall be for the Round, the third his LiÅ¿t, the hearing out muÅ¿t bee as the height: and although this LiÅ¿t is there named with the Capitall, yet it is a part of the Columne, which Columne ought to be made thinner aboue a fourth part; alÅ¿o the Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall in the vppermoÅ¿t part Å¿hall not be greater then the Columne below. The maner to leÅ¿Å¿en the Columne is thus: Let the body of the Columne be deuided in three parts: the third part below Å¿hall hang at the leade, and the other two third parts you Å¿hall deuide into as many equall parts as you will: then at the third part of the columne draw halfe a Circle, and from the liues that hang there, from the outtermoÅ¿t corners of the Capitall inwards, meaÅ¿ure the eyght part, which in all Å¿hall be a fourth part: from vnder the corner (where the Columne is thinneÅ¿t) you Å¿hall draw two lines by a leade, to the halfe circle, and thoÅ¿e parts of the circle outwards, you Å¿hall Å¿et below, in as many euen parts as the two third parts of the Columne holdeth: which being done on both Å¿ides, then there Å¿hall be as many Paralels or croÅ¿Å¿e lines, drawen from the one poynt of the halfe circle to the other, each line being marked with number, from the top downewards, and the like vpon the lynes that deuide the Columnes; which numbers being orderly placed, then it is certayne, that the firÅ¿t line Å¿hall agree with the thinneÅ¿t part of the Columne aboue: after, take the Å¿econd line of the halfe circle, and Å¿et it vpon the Å¿econd line of the Columne, then the third vpon the third, and the fourth vpon the fourth: when that is done, there muÅ¿t be a lyne drawne from the BaÅ¿e of the halfe circle, to the lyne <hi>4.</hi> and from the lyne <hi>4.</hi> to the lyne <hi>3.</hi> and from the line <hi>3.</hi> to the lyne <hi>2.</hi> and from the line <hi>2.</hi> to the lyne <hi>1.</hi> alÅ¿o a lyne: and Å¿o from the Å¿econd Å¿ide of the columne: and although that the lynes in themÅ¿elues are right, yet they make a crooked lyne, which the iudicious workeman knoweth how to regeire and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate at his will on all Å¿ides in the gathering of the lynes. And although this rule is made for the ThuÅ¿can Columne, which is leÅ¿Å¿ned aboue a fourth part, yet it may Å¿erue for all Å¿orts of Columnes; and the more the deuiding of the Columnes and the halfe Circle are in number, Å¿o much the leÅ¿Å¿ening will dimyniÅ¿h.</hi>

That EpiÅ¿iolum or Architraue muÅ¿t be as high as the Capitals, and the Tenia or LiÅ¿t, the Å¿ixt part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. That Sophorus or FrÃ©eÅ¿e of the Å¿ome height. The Cornice alÅ¿o, with her members, muÅ¿t bee the like: and the Å¿ame being deuided in foure parts, one part Å¿hall be for the Cimatie, two parts for the Corona, and the laÅ¿t for the Facie vnder the Å¿ame. The Proiecture or bearing out of them all, muÅ¿t be at leaÅ¿t Å¿o much as their height. And vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in the Corona you may cut channels or hollowings, great or Å¿mall, as the worke is, at the pleaÅ¿ure of the workman.

And, for that neither <hi>Vitruuius,</hi> nor any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther workeman that I haue Å¿Ã©ene, haue Å¿et downe no rule for the Stilobato or PedeÅ¿tal, and in Antiquities, as far as I can Å¿Ã©e, were by workemen made, as neceÅ¿Å¿itie required; whether it were for rayÅ¿ing of Columnes, or to a going vp with Å¿tayres, to Galleries, or by any other occaÅ¿ions: Therefore, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>pelled thereunto, I am of opinion, that euery workeman Å¿hould to each hind of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumne Å¿et a conuenient and Å¿Ã©emely Pede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tall, as reaÅ¿on requireth, and as hee Å¿Ã©eeth cauÅ¿e.

But I will Å¿hew you, that when the Gates of the Citie, Towne or FortreÅ¿Å¿e are placed, how men, in my opinion, Å¿hould Å¿et them forth, Å¿etting down Å¿ome Figures thereof. You muÅ¿t vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derÅ¿tand, that each Gate or Port is to bee after the Italian maner, and ought, of neceÅ¿Å¿ity, to haue a PoÅ¿terne Gate, which are called <hi>Porten van SecourÅ¿e,</hi> which are the Å¿mall Ports on the Å¿ides. But to obÅ¿erue the Semetry, that is, a due meaÅ¿ure, they ought to be made in this manner. The meaÅ¿ure of the Gate is thus, as much as the bredth of the light Å¿hall be, the halfe whereof Å¿hall Å¿erue for the height. The bredth of the light is deuided into Å¿ixe parts, whereof one part Å¿hall be for the bredth of the PilaÅ¿ters on eyther Å¿ide of the Gate: the flat of the Pillars thereof Å¿hall be as broad as the third part of the light, and the height, with Capitals and BaÅ¿es. The height of the BaÅ¿es Å¿hall be a third part of the bredth of the Pillars, and Å¿o much alÅ¿o the Capitals, obÅ¿eruing the rule Å¿et downe in the firÅ¿t Columne. That EpiÅ¿to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum, Zophorus, and Corona Å¿hall be altogether of Å¿uch height, as the bredth of the Pillars, by the rule aforeÅ¿ayd. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the one Pillar and the other, the PoÅ¿ternes or Å¿mall Gates Å¿hall bee, and the wideneÅ¿Å¿e Å¿hall bee as broad as the flat Pillars. The height Å¿hall be twice as much as the bredth: the PilaÅ¿ters Å¿hall be the third part of the Å¿ayd PoÅ¿terne. The eleuation or rayÅ¿ing vp aboue the gate, Å¿hall bee at the workemans will. But the proportion of the FaÅ¿tigies or FrontiÅ¿picie (which is called with vs, the Å¿panning, couer, or roofe) I will Å¿hew in two Å¿orts in the order of Dorica.</p>

                     <p>ANd for that he workeman ought to be copious of inuentions, to pleaÅ¿e himÅ¿elfe and others, the Gate of the City, Towne, or FortreÅ¿Å¿e, may be Å¿et out in this maner, obÅ¿eruing this rule: that Å¿o broad as the going through of the Gate is, the height Å¿hall be as much, and halfe as much agayne, that is, <hi>2.</hi> parts in bredth, and <hi>3.</hi> parts in height. The PilaÅ¿ters Å¿hall be the <hi>8.</hi> part of the wideneÅ¿Å¿e of the Gate: and the Columnes Å¿tand for the round Columnes and flat Pillars, bring the fourth part of the Gate.

                     </head>
                     <p>THe Ancients (as we haue heard) conÅ¿idering the Å¿tate of their gods, ordained Dorica worke, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated the Å¿ame to <hi>Iupiter, Mars,</hi> and <hi>Hercules:</hi> but we build Temples, and dedicate them to <hi>ChriÅ¿t, Paul, Gregory,</hi> and Å¿uch holy perÅ¿onages, that were not onely profeÅ¿Å¿ed Souldiers, but alÅ¿o valiantly and boldly loÅ¿t their liues, and Å¿hed their bloud for the faith of CHRIST. All Å¿uch belong to Dorica, and not to their gods onely, but to men of armes, and Å¿trong perÅ¿onages, being of qualitie more or leÅ¿Å¿e: for whom, if a workeman make or build houÅ¿es or palaces, they muÅ¿t be Dorica: and the nobler the man is for whom Å¿uch worke is done, the Å¿tronger and Å¿tatelyer they ought to be; and the more effeminate that they are, the more Å¿lenderer and pleaÅ¿anter the building Å¿hall be, as I will Å¿hew when time Å¿erueth. But now we will come to the maner of the worke. <hi>Vitruuius</hi> Å¿peaketh of this Dorica worke, in his fourth Booke and third Chapter: but touching BaÅ¿es of Columnes, hee Å¿peaketh thereof in his third Booke; although Å¿ome are of opinion, that he Å¿peaketh &amp; meaneth of the BaÅ¿es of Corinthia, for that they haue bene much vÅ¿ed on the Corinthia Columnes, and Ionica. And Å¿ome alÅ¿o thinke, that Dorica Columnes had no BaÅ¿es, hauing reÅ¿pect to many ancient buildings; as the Theater of <hi>Marcellus,</hi> one of the fayreÅ¿t workes in <hi>Italy,</hi> being the middle downewards Dorica: which Columnes had no BaÅ¿es, the body of the Columnes reÅ¿ting vpon a Å¿tep, without any other Å¿upport. There is at <hi>Carcer Tulliano</hi> the Å¿ignes of a Doricall Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the Columnes whereof are without BaÅ¿es. You may alÅ¿o Å¿ee in <hi>Verona</hi> an Arch tryumphant, of Dorica worke, where the Columnes are without BaÅ¿es. NeuertheleÅ¿Å¿e, for that workemen haue in former times made the Corinthia BaÅ¿es in another maner, as I will Å¿hew hereafter: Therefore I affirme, that the BaÅ¿es Atticurga, which <hi>Vitruuius,</hi> in his third Booke, Å¿o nameth, are the Dorica BaÅ¿es: and this wee Å¿ee, <hi>Bramant</hi> hath obÅ¿erued in his Buildings which he made in <hi>Rome:</hi> which <hi>Bramant,</hi> being the light and Inuentor of good and true Architecture, which from Antiquitie to his time (being vnder Pope <hi>Iulius</hi> the Å¿econd) had beene hidden, we ought to beleeue. Then this BaÅ¿e of Dorica Å¿hall be the height of halfe the thickneÅ¿Å¿e of a Columne: the Plinthus the third part of his height: of the reÅ¿t there Å¿halbe foure parts made; one Å¿hall be for the Thorus aboue: the other three Å¿hall be Å¿et in <hi>3.</hi> euen parts: the one for the Thorus aboue, the Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond for the Trochile or Scotia: but the Å¿ame being deuided in Å¿euen parts, one part Å¿hall be the vppermoÅ¿t liÅ¿t, and another the vndermoÅ¿t. The Proiecture or bearing out of the BaÅ¿e, Å¿hall be of halfe the height, and Å¿o Å¿hall the Plinthus of each Facie hold a thickneÅ¿Å¿e and a halfe of the Columne. And if the BaÅ¿e Å¿tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth below our Å¿ight, the corner vnder the vppermoÅ¿t Thorus, (being of it Å¿elfe darkened) ought to bee Å¿omewhat lower then the other. But if the BaÅ¿e Å¿tandeth aboue our Å¿ight, the corner aboue the nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moÅ¿t Thorus (alÅ¿o of it Å¿elfe darkened) Å¿hall be greater then the other. Thereto alÅ¿o the Scotia, darkened by the Thorus, in Å¿uch caÅ¿e Å¿halbe made more then the meaÅ¿ure appoynted. And in Å¿uch caÅ¿es the worke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man muÅ¿t be iudicious and wary, as <hi>Vitruuius</hi> would haue him to bee learned in the Mathematicall Å¿cience, that doth Å¿tudy his Booke.</p>

The bredth of the Capitall in the vppermoÅ¿t part Å¿hall be in each Facie <hi>2.</hi> Models and a Å¿ixt part and this is according to <hi>Vitruuius</hi> wryting. Although I am of opinion, that this place is falÅ¿ifyed touching the Proiecture, which, in effect, is very lame, in reÅ¿pect of that we Å¿Ã©e in Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities; therefore, after this Capitall, I will make another after my fantaÅ¿ie, with the particular meaÅ¿ures thereof, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter deÅ¿cribed, for that <hi>Vitruuius</hi> doeth it too briefly.</p>

The Echinus Å¿hall alÅ¿o be deuided in <hi>3.</hi> parts, and <hi>2.</hi> third parts being for the Echinus, and the reÅ¿t for the Annulo, which Å¿hall alÅ¿o be deuided in <hi>3.</hi> parts, giuing each of them one. The FrÃ©eÅ¿e Å¿hall bee as the others.

The Guttes Å¿hall bee Å¿ixe in number, hanging vnder the Trigliphes. The height of the Trigliphes or Trigliffe Å¿hall be one Modell and an halfe, and the bredth one Modell: which bredth deuided in <hi>12.</hi> on eyther Å¿ide there Å¿hall be one left for the halfe Channels or hollowings, and of the <hi>10.</hi> parts reÅ¿ting, <hi>6.</hi> Å¿hall bee for the flat of the Trigliphes, and <hi>4.</hi> for the Channels or hollowing in the middle. And from the one Trigliph to the other, there Å¿hall be the Å¿pace of a Modell and a halfe: which Å¿pace Å¿hall be right <hi>4.</hi> Å¿quare (by <hi>Vitruuius</hi> named, Metho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha.) In which Å¿paces, us you pleaÅ¿e, you may Å¿et, cut, or graue, Oxe heads, with DiÅ¿hes; and that, not without Å¿ecret Å¿ignification. For in ancient time, when the vnbelÃ©euing folke Å¿acrificed Oxen, they alÅ¿o vÅ¿ed DiÅ¿hes, &amp; Platters there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, placing Å¿uch things round about their Temples for ornaments. Vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> the Trigliphs, you muÅ¿t place their Capitals: the height whereof Å¿hall be one Å¿ixt part of a Modell. Aboue the Trigliphs or their Capitals, the Corona muÅ¿t bee pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced with <hi>2.</hi> Cimaties, the one aboue, the other below: and they both together deuided into <hi>5.</hi> parts, <hi>3.</hi> for the Corona, and two for the Cimaties. But the height of them all, Å¿halbe of halfe a Modell: vpon the Corona, you muÅ¿t place the Scima: the height whereof is halfe a Modell, and to it you muÅ¿t adde one eyght part for the LiÅ¿t thereof aboue. The Protecture of the Corona Å¿hall bee of <hi>3.</hi> parts: two be in one Modell: in the ground of the Corona, right aboue the Trigliphes, the Guttes were orderly Å¿et, as you Å¿Ã©e them in the Figure hanging beÅ¿ide. AlÅ¿o, betwÃ©ene the Trigliphes are cut Fulmines, that is, winged lightning: or you may leaue the Å¿pacies bare. The Proiecture or bearing out of the Scuna muÅ¿t be like the height thereof: euen Å¿o, each part of the bearing out of the Corona Å¿hall haue their Proiecture like their height. But the more Proiecture the Corona hath, if the Å¿tone may beare it, the more Å¿tatelyer it Å¿heweth. This, we Å¿Ã©e, that the ancient Romanes did obÅ¿erue, as Å¿hall be Å¿hewed when time Å¿erueth, both in Figure and meaÅ¿ure.</p>

But, after that I determined to augment and enrich this Volumne, in Å¿hewing diuers Facies or fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts of Edificies, Temples, Palaces and HouÅ¿es, &amp;c. And for that, when as the Columne Å¿tandeth vpon the ground, they are commendable; yet oftentimes it falleth out, that men haue not their Columnes thicke inough, nor long inough, as they deÅ¿ire, Å¿o that it is neceÅ¿Å¿ary to place PedeÅ¿tals vnder them: therefore I haue made this order fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, the proportion whereof Å¿hall be as followeth: that the wideneÅ¿Å¿e Å¿hall be double in the height: the PilaÅ¿ter with the Arch, Å¿halbe a <hi>12.</hi> part of the wideneÅ¿Å¿e: the Columne as thicke againe: the inter-Columne halfe the wideneÅ¿Å¿e of the light or Doore: the wideneÅ¿Å¿e of the Niches, <hi>2.</hi> Columnes thicke, and <hi>4.</hi> in height: the PedeÅ¿tals, <hi>4.</hi> Columnes thicke in height: his bredth, and the reÅ¿t, as is before Å¿ayd.

                        <p>ALthough in Antiquities, as farre as is found, when workemen had placed the EpiÅ¿tilia vpon the round Columne, they Å¿et nothing elÅ¿e but the FaÅ¿tigium vpon that, vÅ¿ing the Å¿ome order in Churches and Temples, and not in any other buildings: NeuertheleÅ¿Å¿e, I will not omit to Å¿et downe Å¿ome maner of HouÅ¿es without Arches: for if you will make Arches with their foureÅ¿quare Pillars and round Columnes before them for beautifying of the worke, Å¿Ã©eking to make much light in your Callerie, the Pillars with the Arches will hinder a great deale of light: Then if you will Å¿et the Arches onely vpon the round Columnes, that were altogether falÅ¿e, for that the foure corners of the Arch would Å¿urpaÅ¿Å¿e the roundneÅ¿Å¿e or body of the Columnes: therefore I intend, to make Å¿ome HouÅ¿es and other Buildings without Arches, both of this order, and alÅ¿o of the other. This Å¿hall therefore be made in this maner, that the greateÅ¿t inter Columne Å¿hall be the thickneÅ¿Å¿e of foure Columnes, and the Å¿malleÅ¿t of one and an halfe. The height of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnes Å¿hall be of nine parts, with BaÅ¿es and Capitals: the Architraue, FrÃ©eÅ¿e, and Cornice, &amp;c. Å¿hall bee made accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the former rule: the wideneÅ¿Å¿e of the windowes are of two Columnes thicknes: the height a foureÅ¿quare and two third parts: and their PilaÅ¿ters one Å¿ixt part of the light, hauing the Cornice aboue, like the Capitall. The doore Å¿hall be of the bredth of thrÃ©e Columnes, and Å¿euen in height: and Å¿o Å¿hall the lights of the windowes, and of the doores, bee all one height. The Trigliphes and Methophes Å¿hall bee deuided, as you may perceiue. The Å¿econd Å¿tory Å¿hall bee leÅ¿Å¿e or Å¿horter by a fourth part, according as <hi>Vitruuius</hi> giueth counÅ¿ell: Å¿o alÅ¿o, Å¿hall the Architraue, FrÃ©eÅ¿e, and Cornice bee a fourth part leÅ¿Å¿ened: the windowes thereof, with the PilaÅ¿ters, Å¿hould bee as broad as the loweÅ¿t.

And although this houÅ¿e is whole, which is but little for a man that hath a great liuing, yet you may Å¿et it foorth in <hi>5.</hi> Arches, alÅ¿o in <hi>7.</hi> Arches. The DeuiÅ¿ion whereof may be, that each Intercolumne may be of the thickneÅ¿Å¿e of foure Columnes. The height of the Columnes with BaÅ¿es and Capitals of Å¿ixe parts: and aboue them the Arches to be Å¿et of the bredth before, of halfe a Columne: the openneÅ¿Å¿e Å¿hall bee of double proportion.

The corner Columnes Å¿halbe as broad as the other: but they Å¿halbe of <hi>8.</hi> parts and a halfe high. The Å¿econd Å¿tory aboue this, Å¿halbe a fourth part leÅ¿Å¿e: the corner Columnes, with Architraue, FrÃ©eÅ¿e and Cornice, leÅ¿Å¿ened accordingly: The windowes aboue the Arches, with the PilaÅ¿ters, Å¿talbe as wide as thoÅ¿e below: but the height of the <hi>2.</hi> foureÅ¿quares, and the FrÃ©eÅ¿e aboue them, Å¿hall bee as broad as the Supercilium: the Cornice alÅ¿o as much: The Å¿mall windowes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone them, are made for two purpoÅ¿es: The firÅ¿t, the Romes being high, as they Å¿hew outwardly, will make the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers and other roomes much lighter. Secondly, for neceÅ¿Å¿ity a man map make hanging chambers in them, and then thoÅ¿e lights will Å¿erue to good purpoÅ¿e. The third Å¿tory Å¿halbe leÅ¿Å¿e then the Å¿econd a fourth part: and the Å¿ame being deuided in <hi>5.</hi> parts, one part Å¿halbe for the Architraue, FrÃ©eÅ¿e and Cornice: and that part deuided in <hi>3.</hi> one part Å¿halbe for the Architraue and FrÃ©eÅ¿e, and the third for the Cornice: and in the FrÃ©eÅ¿e, the Mutiles and Mogdilions Å¿halbe deuided, as you Å¿Ã©e them. The lights of the windowes Å¿halbe as the others, but they Å¿hall bee a twelfth part higher, becauÅ¿e they are further from the Å¿ight: the PilaÅ¿ters, FrÃ©eÅ¿e and Cornice, Å¿halbe like the other. The FrontiÅ¿pice and Arches Å¿hall be made, as I haue Å¿ayd, in the doores and gates of the Order of the Dorica: for beautifying, or to place another row of Arches in it, you may Å¿et Acroteries or PilaÅ¿ters vpon them, which will paÅ¿Å¿e well in the making of their fire places, or chimneyes for anoyding of Å¿moke. The Å¿paces betwÃ©ene the windowes, that remayne white, are left to bee paynted, as the workeman will, or at the pleaÅ¿ure of the owner of the houÅ¿e.

                     <p>WHEN the Capitall of this Ionica is made, you muÅ¿t make the Volutes, which Å¿hall bee made by the line, called Catheta, which wee heere call, The right Lead: and when you leaue the Abacus vnderneath foure parts, then the firÅ¿t part Å¿hall be for the eye, and Å¿o there yet reÅ¿teth thrÃ©e parts from the eye downe wards; and Å¿o in all, they make eyght, as is before Å¿ayd: the eye Å¿hall be deuided in Å¿ixe parts, and the numbers Å¿et therein, as it is here Å¿et downe; then place one foote of the Compas vpon the poynt <hi>1.</hi> and the other foot vnder the Abacus, draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nether ward, vp to the Catheta, to the eyght part; then letting the Å¿ame foote of the CompaÅ¿Å¿e Å¿tand, bring the other foot of the CompaÅ¿Å¿e to <hi>2.</hi> and draw it vpwards againe to the Catheta. Then hold the foot of the CompaÅ¿Å¿e there, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the other foote to <hi>3.</hi> drawing it then downe wards againe to the Catheta: kÃ©eping that foote there alÅ¿o, bring the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vpon the poynt <hi>4.</hi> then drawing it againe to the Catheta, holding the CompaÅ¿Å¿e there, the foot will come vpon <hi>5.</hi> Å¿o drawing about, doe likewiÅ¿e to <hi>6.</hi> and then it comes to Å¿hut with the eye; there you may make a roofe, it you pleaÅ¿e. The reÅ¿t of the particular members you Å¿hall eaÅ¿ily find with the CompaÅ¿Å¿e. The Å¿trickes of the Columnes, which wee call Chanels or hollowings, Å¿hall be <hi>24.</hi> in number, and one of them Å¿hall be <hi>5.</hi> parts: whereof <hi>4.</hi> Å¿hall be for the Guttes or Chanels, and the <hi>5.</hi> for the LiÅ¿t, by <hi>Vitruuius</hi> called Strix: and Å¿o from one Å¿ide of the flat of the LiÅ¿t to the other, you Å¿hall draw a Å¿trayght line, the middle whereof Å¿hall be the Center of the hollowing out. But if the workeman pleaÅ¿e Å¿ometimes to make a thinne Columne to Å¿hew thicke, then there muÅ¿t bee <hi>28.</hi> Å¿trickes: the Abacus of this Capitall is as broad on the Å¿ides, as before: which Å¿ides are proportioned according to that, which is Å¿ayd before. Friendly Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, I haue layd this Volute, according to my Å¿imple vnderÅ¿tanding, becauÅ¿e <hi>Vitruuius</hi> writing is hard to vnderÅ¿tand, and which is more, promiÅ¿ed the Å¿ame Figure in the laÅ¿t Booke, together, with diuers other ornaments, which Booke is not to bee found.</p>

                        <p>LOuing Reader, there are many things which cannot fully, from poynt to poynt, bee Å¿hewed in Figure, vnleÅ¿Å¿e the workeman muÅ¿t helpe himÅ¿elfe by practiÅ¿e, like as the Cincte or band of theÅ¿e Volutes: which (if the Capitall bee very great) will Å¿tand well: if the bredth contayneth the fourth part of the eye, and if the Capitall bee of indifferent greatneÅ¿Å¿e, then it muÅ¿t be made of a third part of the eye: but if the Capitall be Å¿mall, then it muÅ¿t bee the halfe of the eye, alwayes at the workemans diÅ¿cretion: for I haue Å¿Ã©ene it Å¿o in Antiquities, although they differ. The thickneÅ¿Å¿e being marked aboue, vnder the Abacus, then you muÅ¿t place the CompaÅ¿Å¿e a little below the figure <hi>1.</hi> from aboue the Catheta downe wards: then agayne, you muÅ¿t place the CompaÅ¿Å¿e a little aboue the figure <hi>2.</hi> drawing your line from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath vpwards to the Catheta.</p>
                        <p>Now, whereas I haue Å¿ayd, that the laÅ¿t Booke promiÅ¿ed by <hi>Vitruuius,</hi> is not found, by meanes whereof, diuers opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions are Å¿pred abroad touching the Å¿ame, Å¿ome affirming, that in <hi>Vitruuius</hi> time, there were many vnÅ¿kilfull worke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men (as there are now alÅ¿o) hauing better fortune, then good vnderÅ¿tanding: (others) that preÅ¿umption, Å¿iÅ¿ter to vnÅ¿kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneÅ¿Å¿e, beareth Å¿uch Å¿way among common workemen, that vnderÅ¿tand not themÅ¿elues, it is thought, that <hi>Vitruuius</hi> refuÅ¿ed, or at leaÅ¿t, would not publiÅ¿h it, in regard of the vnthankfulneÅ¿Å¿e of Å¿uch as neglect good learning. Some alÅ¿o affirme, that it was too hard a matter for him to place them in figures; which I can hardly iudge to bee the mind of Å¿uch an Author. But whereas Å¿ome affirme, that this laÅ¿t Booke was Å¿o pleaÅ¿ing and acceptable, in regard of the figures there at large Å¿et out, and he being ouer-carefull in looking vnto it, was robbed thereof, among other riches and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ures, by vnÅ¿kilfull perÅ¿ons: this I belÃ©eue beÅ¿t, is as warre, which is enemy to all good Artes, which yet, at this day, is eÅ¿pecially to be lamented, for that men by the figures, might haue made diuerÅ¿ities of worke in the right maner.</p>

Of this halfe, or height of the BaÅ¿e, there Å¿hall be foure euen parts made, whereof the one is for the Plinthus, the other three Å¿hall be deuided in fiue equall parts, whereof one part Å¿hall bee for the Thorus aboue, but the Thorus vnder Å¿hall be a fourth part thicker: Å¿o that which reÅ¿teth Å¿hall be deuided into 2. euen parts, whereof one part is for the Scotie below, with the AÅ¿tragall, and two LiÅ¿ts or borders: that AÅ¿tragall Å¿hall be the Å¿ixt part, and each liÅ¿t or border the halfe thereof: but the liÅ¿t or border vnder the nethermoÅ¿t Thorus, Å¿hall bee a third part more then the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The Proiecture of the Plinthus Å¿hall Å¿tand aboue in another order of Columnes, making them like the Ionica order; but if the place be beneath vpon the ground, then the Proiecture Å¿hall be like the Dorica order. AlÅ¿o, according to the place where the BaÅ¿es Å¿halbe placed, Å¿o the workeman muÅ¿t adde or diminiÅ¿h, as is before Å¿ayd: for as theÅ¿e BaÅ¿es Å¿tand beneath the Å¿ight, it will Å¿tand well; but if it bee placed aboue the Å¿ight, then all the places that are vÅ¿ed by the other members, with their Å¿eueral diÅ¿tances, Å¿hall be made grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, then by this rule is preÅ¿cribed. And the higher they be Å¿et, Å¿o much the leÅ¿Å¿e and fayrer Å¿eeme the members therein the workeman of the Rotonde was well aduiÅ¿ed, for that hee made the BaÅ¿es aboue the firÅ¿t Å¿tory within, with two Scoties, but yet with one AÅ¿tragall alone, in Å¿tead of two.</hi>

Vnder the foure corners of the Abacus, the greateÅ¿t Volutes are made; and in the middle of the Abacus, there is a flower as great as the Abacus is thicke, vnder the which the leaÅ¿t Volutes Å¿halbe made; vnder the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teÅ¿t, and alÅ¿o vnder the Å¿malleÅ¿t Volutes, the middle leaues Å¿halbe Å¿et, betwÃ©ene the which the leaÅ¿t leaues Å¿hall grow out, and out of them the Volutes Å¿pring.

                     <p>SOme RomiÅ¿h workemen, procÃ©eding with more boldeneÅ¿Å¿e, haue not onely placed Echines aboue the Denticules, but alÅ¿o made Mutiles and Dentiles to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, in one Cornice, which is much condemned by <hi>Vitruuius</hi> in his fourth Booke, and Å¿econd Chapter: for that the Dentiles repreÅ¿ent certaine tÃ©eth, by <hi>Vitruuius</hi> called AÅ¿Å¿eri, and the Mogdilions are for the Å¿upporting of other ends of wood, by the Å¿ayd Author called Cantery: which two kind of beames may not Å¿tand together in one place; and I, for my part, could neuer endure Dentiles and Mutiles in one Cornice, although Rome aboundeth therein, and diuers places of Italy alÅ¿o: but procÃ©eding orderly in this worke, I find a generall rule, that is, that the height of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnes with BaÅ¿es and Capitals, Å¿halbe deuided in <hi>4.</hi> parts, whereof one is giuen to the Architraue, FrÃ©eÅ¿e and Cornice, and Å¿uch a height agreeth with the Dori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca: the fourth part Å¿halbe deuided in <hi>10.</hi> parts: <hi>3.</hi> Å¿hall be for the Architraue, as aforeÅ¿ayd, <hi>3.</hi> for the FrÃ©eÅ¿e, and <hi>4.</hi> for the Cornice.

                     <p>AMong other Antiquities of the Corinthia, which are Å¿Ã©ene in <hi>Italy,</hi> I thinke the Pantheon of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Arch tryumphant, at the Hauen of Ancona, are the fayreÅ¿t and beÅ¿t to be Å¿Ã©ene: of which Arch; the Capitall hereunder marked <hi>A.</hi> is with great care proportioned after the great: which height is contrary to the writing of <hi>Vitruuius:</hi> neuertheleÅ¿Å¿e, it had good correÅ¿pondencie; &amp; it may be, that <hi>Vitruuius</hi> meant, that the height of the Capitall Å¿hould be one Columnes thickeneÅ¿Å¿e without the Abacus: but the text herein is falÅ¿ified, for that I haue not onely found this Capitall, but others more of Å¿uch proportion. The Columnes hereof are chaneled, as it is Å¿hewed here: the PedeÅ¿tall with the BaÅ¿e vpon it, is a member of the Å¿ame Arch, alÅ¿o proportioned in the Å¿mall: the Cornice hereunto added, was found at <hi>Al foro tranÅ¿itorio</hi> in <hi>Rome:</hi> that marked with <hi>A.</hi> is very handÅ¿ome, for a Corinthian Cornice without Mog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dilions: that marked with <hi>B.</hi> is a little fayrer; but that with <hi>C.</hi> is the vnhandÅ¿omeÅ¿t, becauÅ¿e of the double parts, which haue no good grace from the Corona downewards: and alÅ¿o, for that the Corona, vpon Å¿o much Cornice, hath Å¿o Å¿mall Proiecture. The BaÅ¿e of the PedeÅ¿tall marked <hi>D.</hi> in my opinion, is very fayre, and alÅ¿o the BaÅ¿ement with <hi>E.</hi> I thinke hath bÃ©ene a thing that hath continued in Å¿ome building: which things, altogether, men may applie to the order of Corinthia; and in the Ionica I haue Å¿Ã©ene the like.

                     <p>AS much as nÃ©ed required, I haue Å¿poken of Corinthia; although a man might Å¿peake of diuers kindes of orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: but it is nÃ©edfull to Å¿peake of the ornament of a Chimney, becauÅ¿e of the dayly vÅ¿e thereof, Å¿o that a man cannot bee without it: for not onely in great, but alÅ¿o in Å¿mall Chambers men vÅ¿e to make fire, where, in Å¿uch Å¿traight places, they Å¿et Å¿uch Chimneyes within the wall, whereon a man may make diuers ornaments after the Corinthia maner. But if you make them in this forme, then the wideneÅ¿Å¿e muÅ¿t be taken, according to the Å¿ituation of the place: and the PilaÅ¿ter Å¿hall be made of the Å¿ixt part of the wideneÅ¿Å¿e; but of the eyght part the worke will be Å¿Ã©eme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyer: the which PilaÅ¿ter or Antepagmentum, together with the Supercilium, Å¿hall bee deuyded like the Architraue of the Corinthia. This FrÃ©eÅ¿e aboue, becauÅ¿e it is grauen, Å¿halbe made a fourth part greater then the Supercilium. The Cornice, together with the Capitals of the Mutiles, Å¿hall hold as much as the Supercilium, and the Å¿ame deuided in thrÃ©e, as it is Å¿ayd of the Cornice, in the Corinthia. The bredth of the Mutiles, or Ancones (as we Å¿ay) aboue, Å¿halbe like the PilaÅ¿ter, but beneath, which reacheth down to the opening, they Å¿halbe one fourth part Å¿malle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>IN a Hall or a great Chamber there is a great Chimney required, proportioned according to the diÅ¿tance, the which nÃ©edeth a great conueyance; therefore, if a man will make the Modiglions Å¿ufficient for Å¿uch a bearing out, hee muÅ¿t make two places on the Å¿ides: but in Å¿uch a caÅ¿e (I meane) he Å¿hould make two flat Columnes, and before them round Pillars, not cloÅ¿e to the other, in Å¿uch maner, that betwÃ©ene them both the place for the Columne muÅ¿t be, and in this maner you Å¿hall adorne them. As I Å¿ayd in the beginning of this Chapter, the Corinthian maner had her beginning from a mayd, of the Towne of Corinthia: therefore I haue placed a mayd here, in Å¿tead of a Columne: the height and bredth of the opening, being made according to the place, the height Å¿hall be deuided in nine parts, and one of thoÅ¿e parts Å¿hall be for the heads of the mayds, and the whole Figure being formed and Å¿waddled, as you Å¿Ã©e: then the <hi>flat</hi> Columne or the Pillar Å¿hall be of the Å¿ame proportion, obÅ¿eruing the meaÅ¿ure before Å¿et downe.

And hauing therein placed the 3. orders one vpon the other, viz.

                        <p>THe Workenan is to haue a great iudgement, becauÅ¿e of the diuerÅ¿itie of compoÅ¿ition in Ornaments of buildings, for that there are Å¿ome places in Architecture, of the which there may, almoÅ¿t, certayne rules be giuen, for they are no accidents that happen contrary to our opinions, for euery day we Å¿Ã©e Å¿ome Columnes, that with their different poÅ¿itions, Å¿hew different meaÅ¿ures in themÅ¿elues, according to the places where they Å¿tand. TheÅ¿e alterations are Å¿o made in buildings in <hi>4.</hi> wayes, that is, Å¿etting the Columnes almoÅ¿t in an InÅ¿ule, without any companion to helpe it eyther on the Å¿ides or behind. TheÅ¿e certaynely beare a great waight, and in their height they goe not aboue the aforeÅ¿ayd rule: the example hereof is in the firÅ¿t Columne marked <hi>A.</hi> but if you place them againÅ¿t the wall (though they bee round) by the which being vnderholden and holpen, a man may make another thickneÅ¿Å¿e higher aboue the Å¿ame: the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample thereof is in the Columne <hi>B.</hi> Or alÅ¿o drawing alone two third parts from the wall, there may yet a thickneÅ¿Å¿e or wall go higher then the other, for that you Å¿Ã©e the like in Å¿ome buildings, that riÅ¿e to nine thicker &amp; a halfe, and moÅ¿t in the ColiÅ¿eo of Rome, in the Order of Dorica, as it is Å¿hewed in the <hi>3.</hi> Columne <hi>C.</hi> but they are more holpen when they haue PilaÅ¿ters on the Å¿ides, which bearing all the waight, giue the workeman meanes to make the Columnes more Å¿Ã©emely, and Å¿o Å¿lender, that they may be Å¿ayd rather to be placed there to fill a roome for beautifying, then for Å¿trength. You may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿o draw a Columne two third parts out of the wall, and on each Å¿ide Å¿et halfe a Pillar, which will helpe the Columnes Å¿o well, that you may make another thickneÅ¿Å¿e aboue: and in this caÅ¿e, the Architraue, FrÃ©eÅ¿e and Cornice may beare out vpon the round Columne, yea although it were flat, becauÅ¿e the halfe Pillars would hold the Architrane, &amp;c. on the Å¿ides: but vpon one Columne alone, it is vicious to make Å¿uch worke bearing out, for the other parts beÅ¿ides Å¿hould be abando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned without any helpe. This example you Å¿Ã©e in the Columne <hi>D.</hi> But when the Columnes haue any waight to beare vp, without the helpe of another, and Å¿hall haue fit Intercolumnes, it Å¿hall not be thought mÃ©ete to excÃ©ede order, yea, although they haue Story vpon Story to beare vp: it is reaÅ¿on that they Å¿hould be made b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>But touching the Å¿etting of Columne vpon Columne, there are diuers reaÅ¿ons: The firÅ¿t is, that the Proiecture of the PedeÅ¿tals of the Columnes placed aboue, Å¿hould go no further out, then the thickneÅ¿Å¿e of the vndermoÅ¿t Columne; and this Å¿hould be a moÅ¿t certayne reaÅ¿on: but for that the Å¿econd Story Å¿hould leÅ¿Å¿en much from the firÅ¿t, and would Å¿erue no more for any other Story, conÅ¿idering the great leÅ¿Å¿ening enÅ¿uing, another reaÅ¿on, and more to the purpoÅ¿e, is this: That the flat of the PedeÅ¿tall ought, at leaÅ¿t, to be in Perpendicular with the Columne below, and to Å¿et the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumne aboue this PedeÅ¿tall, leÅ¿Å¿ened a fourth part from that which Å¿tandeth vnder, as well in thickneÅ¿Å¿e as in height: Å¿o this rule agrÃ©eth with that of <hi>Vitruuius</hi> in Theatrum: which figure is aboue the Columne <hi>A.</hi> and if you will not leÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿en the Columne Å¿o much, then you muÅ¿t make the vppermoÅ¿t Columne as thicke as the nethermoÅ¿t is in the vppermoÅ¿t part: but in this caÅ¿e, the flat or maÅ¿Å¿y part of the PedeÅ¿tall would be broader then the nethermoÅ¿t Columne is thicke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low: neuertheleÅ¿Å¿e, thoÅ¿e of the Theater of <hi>Marcellus</hi> worke that effect. The example hereof is in the Columne <hi>B.</hi> and theÅ¿e thrÃ©e reaÅ¿ons are probable inough. But the ancient Romanes, in the great Edifice of the ColiÅ¿eo, made the Columne Ionica, Corinthia and CompoÅ¿ita all of one thickneÅ¿Å¿e; and the Dorica, vnder all the other, they made thicker, about the twentieth part. And this (in my opinion) they did by good aduice: for if they had leÅ¿Å¿ened all the Columnes the fourth part, one aboue the other, the laÅ¿t, in Å¿o great a building, by reaÅ¿on of the great diÅ¿tance, would haue Å¿hewed very Å¿mall, which we now Å¿Ã©e to be of good correÅ¿pondence, by reaÅ¿on of the height. The Å¿hewing of this is in the Columne <hi>C.</hi> And as the Columne aboue the Columne <hi>D.</hi> is leÅ¿Å¿e then that which Å¿tandeth loweÅ¿t one fourth part: for that, if a man hath a reaÅ¿onable houÅ¿e to make of <hi>3.</hi> Stories, Å¿o I would not thinke it amiÅ¿Å¿e, that a man Å¿hould leÅ¿Å¿en euery Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie the fourth part, according to <hi>Vitruuius</hi> aduice: but if the building be high, then you were better obÅ¿erue the Order of the ColiÅ¿eo, that the Stories Dorica, Ionica and Corinthia, may each bee about one height, but the Story aboue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaÅ¿eth in height about the fift part: and this is Å¿o (as I haue Å¿ayd) becauÅ¿e of the great diÅ¿tances which part, by meanes of the great diÅ¿tance, Å¿Ã©emes to be of the height that the reÅ¿t are: and although that the Å¿hewing of theÅ¿e Columnes is Doricall, yet it is Å¿o in all Å¿orts of Columnes.</p>

                        <p>HAuing Å¿poken of Å¿o many and diuers Ornaments of Å¿tones, it is requiÅ¿ite, that I Å¿hould alÅ¿o Å¿hew how they are to be placed in worke; and Å¿pecially, when a man is to mixe hard Å¿tones &amp; bricks together, which requireth great diligence and Arte: for that bricks are like fleÅ¿h in a pÃ©ece of worke, and hard Å¿tones like the bones to knit and hold them together: which two things, if they be not well and faÅ¿tly bound together, they will, in time, decay: and therefore the foundation being made in Å¿uch maner as the place affordeth, it is requiÅ¿ite, that the prouident workeman Å¿hould make ready, all the hard Å¿tones, and alÅ¿o the bricks, with the reÅ¿t of the Å¿tuffe belonging thereunto, and Å¿o Å¿hould come to lay and ioyne the hard Å¿tones and the bricks together, all at one time: and it is requiÅ¿ite, that the hard Å¿tones Å¿hould be Å¿et Å¿o farre with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the wall, that although there were no morter to hold them together, yet they Å¿hould, of themÅ¿elues, Å¿tand faÅ¿t in the wall: which doing, the worke will be Å¿trong and continue hard. The example hereof is Å¿Ã©ene in the other Å¿ide, by the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure <hi>A.</hi> where it is alÅ¿o Å¿hewed, how a man may make places breÅ¿t high, without feare. And if you haue PedeÅ¿tals with Columnes to Å¿et vpon them, where hard and Å¿oft Å¿tones are mixed together, if the hard Å¿tones be not well ioyned with the Å¿oft, as you Å¿Ã©e in the figure <hi>B.</hi> the worke will not continue long. And if the Columnes be of diuers pÃ©eces, Å¿ome of them (that is the leaÅ¿t) Å¿hall goe dÃ©epe into the wall, to hold the other the faÅ¿ter. But if the Columnes bee of one pÃ©ece, them they would Å¿tand, at leaÅ¿t, a third part within the wall; but the BaÅ¿es and Capitals muÅ¿t enter much more into the wall, and aboue all the Corona and other Cornices, which beare farre out from the wall. The innermoÅ¿t part that is vnwrought, muÅ¿t counteruayle that which is without, that it may beare it Å¿elfe: but if at the Å¿ame time a man will make any worke or Facie vpon the Å¿tones, then it is requiÅ¿ite, that the workeman, before he begins to lay any worke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue the ground, Å¿hould make ready all his Å¿tones, together with the other Å¿tuffe belonging thereunto: and Å¿o laying and knitting the Å¿tones with the bricks together, I Å¿ay, that he Å¿hall doe well to Å¿et Å¿ome of the Å¿tones Å¿o dÃ©epe into the wall, that they may hold the other pÃ©eces together by force, ioyning well in, as you Å¿Ã©e it in the figure <hi>C.</hi> that in time they may not ryue and breake aÅ¿under one from the other. But that the wall, made of bricke, Å¿hould not Å¿inke, and Å¿inking, Å¿hould breake the thinneÅ¿t parts, by reaÅ¿on of the waight aboue, it is neceÅ¿Å¿ary to haue bricke well burnt, and morter well tempered, &amp; betwÃ©ene the Å¿tones little morter, &amp; wel layd and ioyned one vpon the other: And aboue all, Å¿uch worke would not be made by any force, nor waight vpon waight, to be packt in haÅ¿te, but you muÅ¿t let it reÅ¿t Å¿omewhat from lay to lay: for if a man wil worke in haÅ¿te, and Å¿et great waight vpon it, it is moÅ¿t certayne, the wall will Å¿inke, and the Å¿tones being not able to beare Å¿he waight, will breake; but if it be made with leyÅ¿er, then the Å¿tuffe will be as it Å¿hould be: ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleÅ¿Å¿e, I would alwayes more commend the worke that is wholy bound in the wall, then that which is ioyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether or couered; and Å¿pecially, in my opinion, men Å¿hould not make them in walles that Å¿tand outward, for that the houÅ¿es which haue bÃ©ene made Å¿o in former time, by ancient workemen, and were couered ouer with Marble and other fine Å¿tones, are now Å¿Ã©ene all without Å¿tones before, and nothing but the wall of bricke, that Å¿tood behind them, Å¿tandeth Å¿till: but thoÅ¿e buildings, where the hard Å¿tones are bound and ioyned into, and with the bricks, are yet Å¿tand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: neuertheleÅ¿Å¿e, if you will make Å¿uch worke Å¿imple, I thinke this the Å¿ureÅ¿t way, although Å¿ome workemen, in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers places of <hi>Italy,</hi> haue made Å¿ome building, with Å¿imple walles, leauing places in them for hard Å¿tones to be put in, and after, at another time, haue put in Å¿uch Ornaments: neuertheleÅ¿Å¿e, for that Å¿uch things are not well faÅ¿tened in the wall, but in a maner hackt, you may in many places Å¿Ã©e the pÃ©eces falne, and euery day more and more decay.</p>

And the Author rehearÅ¿eth di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers excellent workemen, whome (for breuitie Å¿ake) I will omit, that onely vÅ¿ed to paynt nothing elÅ¿e but white and blacke in houÅ¿es, and yet Å¿o excellently well, that it made men wonder to behold them. A man may alÅ¿o, with good reaÅ¿on, make and Å¿et forth certayne openings in walles of lodgings, round about the Courts, and make ayre, lantÅ¿haps, houÅ¿es, figures, beaÅ¿ts, and Å¿uch like things, as hee will in colours. AlÅ¿o, if a man hath Chambers, Halles, or other places, about the ground within, to paynt and Å¿et forth, then a Paynter, in maner of Architecture, may make open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings to Å¿ee through them, as the place is: for aboue the Å¿ight a man muÅ¿t make nothing but ayre or Å¿kyes, roofes, high hilles, and the vpper part of houÅ¿es: and if you place figures alÅ¿o aboue the Å¿ight, a man muÅ¿t Å¿ee vnder them, and not the ground whereon they Å¿tand. And if the Paynter will make a Hall or any other, or further roome perÅ¿pectiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he may, ouer the going in, with order of Architecture, make it to Å¿hew further then in effect it is. And this, <hi>Baltha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar</hi> (a man excellently well learned in Architecture) did, in beautifying the Hall of <hi>AuguÅ¿tin GuyÅ¿e,</hi> a Marchant of Rome, where, in that fort he Å¿et out Å¿ome Columnes, and other Architecture to that purpoÅ¿e: Å¿o that <hi>Peter Aretin,</hi> a man alÅ¿o Å¿kilfull in Paynting and in PoeÅ¿ie, Å¿ayd, that there had not beene a perfiter Paynter then he in that houÅ¿e, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though there is worke alÅ¿o in it of <hi>Raphaels</hi> owne doing. And when the walles are paynted, and if you will haue the roofe alÅ¿o done, then follow the Å¿teps of Antiquitie, making things that are called Grootes, which, for that you may make them as you will, Å¿hew well therein, as Leaues, Flowers, BeaÅ¿ts, Birds, and other mixed matter. If a man maketh any clothes or apparell of figures, or which are made faÅ¿t on them, therein a man may doe as he will. But if a Payn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter will make any figures according to the life, in a roofe of a houÅ¿e, then he muÅ¿t be very Å¿kilfull, and much exerciÅ¿ed in PerÅ¿pectiue worke, and very iudicious to chuÅ¿e Å¿uch things as are fitteÅ¿t for the place, and rather heauenly flying things, then carthly things, with Å¿uch Arte, that he muÅ¿t Å¿horten the figures Å¿o (although they bee monÅ¿trous) that when men Å¿tand a conuenient diÅ¿tance off from them, they may reÅ¿emble the life. Which thing is excellently well made in <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

And which is more, I would Å¿ay, that each place Å¿hould be Å¿tuffed and Å¿uted within, with things Å¿itting to that which it Å¿heweth outward. I Å¿ay then, If the Roofe be high, then the deuiÅ¿ions to be wide of Å¿pace, and riÅ¿ing or bearing out well: and if a man will beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie it with Paynting, it muÅ¿t bee well done, and conformably paynted, according to the greatneÅ¿Å¿e and diÅ¿tance thereof. It ought alÅ¿o to be made of light and browne colours: and in the middle of the field you muÅ¿t Å¿et a gylt RoÅ¿e: but if a man will colour it, then the field muÅ¿t be blue, as piercing, but the RoÅ¿es muÅ¿t be bound with Å¿ome works or branches, that they may not Å¿eeme to hang in the ayre: and the Cornices which cloÅ¿e vp the foureÅ¿quare or other fields, muÅ¿t bee well gylt, or beautifyed with the Å¿ame colour: but if Å¿o bee the Roofe is not high inough, then you muÅ¿t make the worke thinner and Å¿maller, as alÅ¿o the paynting: and that you may vnderÅ¿tand it, I haue Å¿et two figures to Å¿hew you, which, notwithÅ¿tanding, are all one: the one of bare wood, the other paynted, as I Å¿ayd before. And this Order I obÅ¿erued in the Roofe of the great Librarie in the Palace of <hi>Venice,</hi> in the time of the Prince <hi>Andreagriti,</hi> becauÅ¿e the Roofe was lower then it Å¿hould be, in reÅ¿pect of the wideneÅ¿Å¿e and length of the Hall, and I made it of thinne worke, for the reaÅ¿on aforeÅ¿ayd.</p>

The Diameter of this ground Å¿hall be as long as high, according to the Figure of the Circle, that is, of 60. foote. The thickneÅ¿Å¿e of the wall Å¿hall be the fourth part of the Diameter, that is, 15. foote, that a man may eaÅ¿ily make the Chappels within it: which Chappels Å¿hall be 12. footbroad. The Niches betweene the Pillars Å¿hall bee foure foote broad: the other in the Entrie, and of the three Chappels, Å¿hall be Å¿ixe foote and a halfe broad: and to Å¿pare charges of Å¿tone and lime, the great Niches Å¿hall be made without the Chappell: the bredth whereof Å¿hall bee 15. foote. This Chappell is eleuated from the earth at leaÅ¿t fiue Å¿teps; and if it were higher, it were not amiÅ¿Å¿e: for the earth in time riÅ¿eth, Å¿o that men goe downeward into many old Temples and Churches, whereunto, in former time they aÅ¿cended vpwards: but this Stayre would alwayes be vneuen, according to <hi>Vitrunius</hi> writing, Å¿peaking of Temples, where he Å¿ayth: that as a man with his right foote begins to clyme vp, he may, with the Å¿ayd right foote, Å¿tep vpon the pauement of the Temple. Touching the foundation, a man cannot Å¿ayle, if hee maketh it deepe and broad inough: but the leaÅ¿t bredth that a man can lay, is this: that a man Å¿hould from the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ameter of the thickeneÅ¿Å¿e of the wall, make a perfit foureÅ¿quare, and the Diagonus of this foureÅ¿quare Å¿hall be the bredth of the foundation vnder the wall. And Å¿o, I thinke, <hi>Vitrunius</hi> writeth, where he Å¿peak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of foundations. But touching the Stofes of foundations, in faÅ¿t or hard ground, and alÅ¿o in watry ground, I neede not Å¿hew it here, becauÅ¿e euery man knowes it.</p>
