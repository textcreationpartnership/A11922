            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                           <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lthough the ſubtill and ingenious Arte of Perſpectiue is very difficult and troubleſome to ſet downe in writing, and ſpecially the body, or modell of things, which are drawen out of the ground: for it is an Arte which cannot be ſo well expreſſed by figures or writings, as by an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſhewing, which is done ſeuerally: Notwithſtanding, ſeeing that in my firſt Booke I haue ſpoken of Geometry, without the which Perſpectiue Arte is nothing: I will labour in the brie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt manner that I can in this my ſecond Booke, to ſhewe the workeman ſo much thereof, that hee ſhall bee able to aide and helpe himſelfe therewith.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>In this worke I will not trouble my ſelfe to diſpute Philoſophically what Perſpectiue is, or from whence it hath the originall: for learned <hi>Euclides</hi> writeth darkely of the ſpeculation thereof.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But to proceede to the matter, touching that the workeman ſhall haue cauſe to vſe, you muſt vnderſtand, that Perſpectiue is that, which <hi>Vitruuius</hi> calleth Scenographie, that is, the vpright part and ſides of any buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding or of any Superficies or bodies.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>This Perſpectiue then, conſiſteth principally in three lines: The firſt line is the Baſe below, from whence all things haue their beginning. The ſecond line is that, which goeth or reacheth to the point, which ſome call ſight, others, the horiſon: But the horiſon is the right name thereof, for the horiſon is in euery place whereſoeuer ſight endeth. The third line, is the line of the diſtances, which ought alwayes to ſtand ſo high as the horiſon is farre or neere, according to the ſituation, as when time ſerueth, I will declare.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>This Horiſon is to be vnderſtood to ſtand at the corners of our ſight, as if the workeman would ſhew a piece of worke againſt a flat wall, taking his beginning from the ground, where the feete of the beholders ſhould ſtand. In ſuch caſe it is requiſite, that the Horiſon ſhould bee as high as our eye, and the diſtance to ſee or behold that worke, ſhall be ſet or placed in the fitteſt place thereabouts, as if it were in a Hall, or a Chamber, then the diſtance ſhall be taken at the entry thereof: but if it bee within, or at the end of a Gallery or Court, then the diſtance ſhall be ſet at the entry of the ſame place, and if it bee in a Streete againſt a wall or an houſe, then you muſt ſet your diſtance on the other ſide, right ouer againſt it. But if in ſuch a caſe the ſtreete is very narrow, then it were good to imagine a broad diſtance, leſt the ſhortening fall out to be ouer-tedious or vnpleaſant vnto you: for the longer or the wyder the diſtance is, the worke will ſhew ſo much the better and pleaſanter.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But if you will begin a piece of worke of fiue or ſixe foote high from the ground whereon you ſtand, then it is requiſite that the Horiſon ſhould ſtand euen with your eyes (as I ſayd before) but if a man ſhould ſee no ground of the worke, whereon the vppermoſt part doeth ſtand (and a man would worke very high) it would not be correſpondent with the eyes: In ſuch a caſe a man muſt take vpon him to place the Horiſon ſomewhat higher, by the aduice of ſome ſkilfull workman, which maketh hiſtories or other things vpon Houſes, thirtie or fortie foote high aboue a mans ſight, which is vnfittingly. But cunning workmen fall into no ſuch errors; for where they haue made any thing aboue our ſight, there you could ſee no ground of the ſame worke, for that the notable Perſpectiue Art hath bridled them: and therefore (as I ſayd before) Perſpectiue Art is very neceſſary for a workeman: And no Perſpectiue workeman can make any worke without Architecture, nor the Architecture without Perſpectiue.</hi>

                        <hi>To proue this, it appeareth by the Architectures in our dayes, wherein good Architecture hath begun to appeare and ſhew it ſelfe: For, was not <hi>Bramant</hi> an excellent Architector, and was he not firſt a Painter, and had great skill in Perſpectiue Art, before he applyed himſelfe to the Art of Architecture? and <hi>Raphael Durbin,</hi> was not he a moſt cunning Paynter, and an excellent Perſpectiue Artiſt, before he became an Archite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor?

Was not learned <hi>Ieronimus Genga</hi> alſo an excellent Paynter and moſt cunning in Perſpectiue Arte, as the faire works, which he made for the pleaſure of his Lord <hi>Franciſco Maria,</hi> Duke of <hi>Vrbin,</hi> can teſtifie; vnder whom he became a moſt excellent Architector? <hi>Iulius Romanus,</hi> a ſcholler of <hi>Raphael Durbin;</hi> who, by Perſpectiue Arte and Paynting, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came an excellent Architector, witneſſeth the ſame. Then to come to my purpoſe; I ſay, that a man muſt be diligent and vigilant in this Arte, wherein I will begin with ſmall things, and then proceed to greater; vntill I haue ſhewed you the full Arte and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner thereof, as I deſire.</hi>

                     <p>TO the ende that men by ſmall matters may attaine to greater, therefore I will begin to ſhew how to ſhorten a foure cornerd thing, from whence all the reſt ſhall bee deriued. Then the Baſe of this foure ſquare thing, ſhall be <hi>A.

And then, taking <hi>H.

But if you will make more foure ſquares one aboue the other, vpon the ſame Horiſon or poynt: then you muſt draw another line from the ſhortening poynt of the foure ſquare or Quadrant, to the letter <hi>I.</hi> and where it cutteth through the Perpendicular line aforeſaid, that is at <hi>C,</hi> there the ſecond Quadrant ſhalbe rut off, and in like ſort you muſt draw another line to the poynt of the diſtance: and where it toucheth the Lead, or Perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicular line that is on <hi>D.</hi> you ſhall make the third Quadrante, the ſame may be done with <hi>E.</hi> and ſo you muſt goe, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till you come iuſt vnder the Horiſon.</p>

The Quadrant being mede in ſhortening, you muſt deuide the Baſe into ten equall parts, and on either ſide you ſhall leaue three parts, and in the middle foure parts, then the two lines being drawen to the Horiſon, you ſhall find the terminations of the Paralel lines, by the Diagonal lines, whereby you may cloſe vp the eyght corners, as you may ſée it in the Figure.</p>

                     <p>THE ſhorteſt way to place this ſixe cornerd Quadrant, in Perſpectiue workes, is thus; When the Quadrant according to the rule aforeſaid, is pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in ſhortening, then you muſt make foure equall parts of the Baſes, whereof two ſhall be in the middle, and on each ſide you muſt leaue one, and then draw the lines vpwards to the Horiſon or poynts: then you muſt draw the Diagonall lines, and in the middle where they méet together, you muſt draw a Paralel line cleaue through, by the which you ſhall finde all the points to make this ſixe cornerd Figure.</p>

Wherefore a man muſt imagine that the round Body lying below in his foureſquare is made, and ſhall ſerue for the two Bowes on the ſides. This Body then being made (as I haue ſhewed before) and as you ſée it better now, you muſt firſt ſet it, where the Arches begin about the Horiſon. And the ſame Perpendicular lines which ſtand corner wiſe from the middle of the foure cornerd body, muſt be ſet like Paralel lines on the right &amp; left ſides vpwards from the two Arches, there (at it is afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid) to direct the Horiſentall lines, as you may ſée it plainely in the Figure. But you muſt vnderſtand, that the two croſſes below in this Body, are the two Centers to draw the ſtones of the Arches both aboue and below, they alſo ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie the Centers of the Bowes vpon the Horiſentall lines within the Arches.</p>
                     <p>You muſt alſo vnderſtand, that the blacke lines doe forme the Circumference without, and the prickes or this lines betoken the forme within; which is couered in the Arches: ſo that the Arches do ſhew through to be made of pieces, of the which pieces a man may learne to make diuers Compartements vnderneath in the Arch. Now when a man can make this Arch well, then hee ſhall not neede ſtill to take all this labour, but by two principall lines helping himſelfe with pricks, he may frame the Arch; and ſpecially, becauſe that the Arch which ſhould come before, couereth or hideth a great part of the Arches on both ſides: which Arch I haue not made here, that I might not darken or ſhadow the other ſhorte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Arch. Neither néed I wryte any thing of the Circumferences aboue in the top or Roofe, (nor the eyght corners within) for that in the next Figure you ſhall ſée them; neither will I ſpeake any thing of the Circumferences in the ground, for they are made (as I haue taught you heretofore of all others) and of the round body below (of the which there hath beene more ſayd) a man may make many other things which are not here to be ſpoken of.</p>

                     <p>TO place Pillars with their Arches vpon grounds or platformes, I thinke there is ſufficient ſpoken before; and whatſoeuer I haue ſpoken of foure ſquare Pillars, is alſo to bee vnderſtood of round Columnes, for that a man muſt take all round things, out of foure ſquare things as well the Spira of the Baſe, as the round of the Capital. He that can make all the Figures aforeſayd perfectly, and particularly this laſt body, ſhall helpe himſelfe well, and not onely to doe the like things, but alſo to do many more. If I ſhould in this ſmall Treatiſe ſhew all that I could ſet downe, it would make a moſt great Volumne; and peraduenture I ſhould want time to ſet foorth the reſt of my Booke, which I haue already promiſed: for there are many things that belong to Building, which need not to bee ſet downe in Perſpectiue worke.</p>
                     <p>Let vs now begin to rayſe the Building here ſet downe out of the ground, which before, and at the one ſide is ſéene, as I promiſed before to ſhew you.</p>
                     <p>The ſhorteſt and ſureſt way is, to mak a ground with many Quadrants; and imagine that it is mete with the Foot, with the Elle, or other meaſure: But <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>et vs now take euery Quadrant for two foot, and as before there are foure Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drants from one Pillar to the other; and the Pillar alſo containeth a Quadran, there ſhall alſo be foure Quadrants vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in the length from one Pillar to the other, as you may ſee it altogether in the Figure.</p>
                     <p>The Pillars then being ſet of ſuch height as you deſire, then the Arches vpon them moſt be made; and the manner how to make them, you may expreſly ſee in the Figure. And although you cannot ſee the Arches that are behind them, yet I haue made them here that you may ſée their terminations: they are in ſome places drawne with full blacke lines, and in ſome places with prickes.</p>
                     <p>Aboue the Arches you muſt make the Architraue, Friſe and Cornice; the Proiecture whereof, you muſt make as I haue ſayd and taught heretofore, that is, how they make their corners againſt the two Diagonall lines, and by the like rule you ſhall alſo make the vppermoſt Cornice, as you may ſée in the vppermoſt part, where the ſmall Quadrant with the Diagonall lines ſtand. The doores that ſtand vnder in the Gallery, are each of them two Quadrants broad, and foure Quadrants high: below in the ground there are certaine tokens which ſhew like Nayles, which ſignifie the wydeneſſe of the windowes aboue the Cornice: which windowes if they ſtood whole there, then they would be twice as high as they are broad. The other Nayles vpwards betwéene the ſhortening Pillars, are alſo the bredth of the ſhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tening Pillars, which (as I ſayd before) are all foure Quadrants high, but they are partly couered with the Cornices. The part of the Arch which ſtandeth at the ende, is ſeparated from this Gallery, as the ground alſo ſheweth it.</p>
                     <p>I haue here made no Baſes nor Capitals, that the other things might not bee confounded: but you muſt vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that they muſt be placed in the worke, as is ſufficiently before ſhewed. And by this rule you may draw diuers Buildings out of the ground, as in the Figure following ſhall be ſhewed in diuers formes. The Centers of the Arches you ſee them marked, ſtanding all vpon one Horiſentall line.</p>

                     <p>NOw I haue ſhewed the manner how to make a Gallery with Arches and Pillars, with other things thereunto belonging; now by an eaſier way I will ſhew ſome forme of Houſes that are to be built out of the ground. You muſt make a ground or foote worke with Quadrants reatching long inough vpwards, which Quadrants muſt each of them be reckoned at two foote ſquare.</p>
                     <p>And firſt, at the entry of the Houſe there ſhall be a doore of fiue foote broad, for that it containeth two Quadrants and a halfe in the ſhortening: end the height thereof ſhall be of ten foote, becauſe it is fiue Quadrants high: Her Pilaiſters or Antipagmentum ſhall bee a foote broad, becauſe they containe a halfe ſhortening Quadrant; the Friſe ſhall alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine as much: and the Cornice ſhall containe ſo much leſſe, as the vnder part thereof hearing ouer containeth, and ſhall be made according to the rule afore ſhewed. Touching the part yetting ouer the doore, the Megdiliones or Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, ſhal ſtand right aboue the Pilaiſters or Antipagmentum of the doore. And that litle doore vpon the yetting, ſhall ſtand right in the middle aboue the loweſt doore, and ſhall be two foote broad. In the other corner of this firſt Houſe, there ſhall be another doore, the wideneſſe thereof ſhall be ſixe foote; you may make it round or ſquare aboue as you wil. But why doe I ſpend my time to ſet downe all theſe meaſures, which you may ſo plainely ſée in the Figure; onely it is neceſſary to warne ſuch as are ſtudious herein, that what worke ſoeuer a man rayſeth out of the ground, conſiſteth in three principall things, that is, in length, bredth and height. The length is of certaine Houſes or Roomes, containing a certaine number of féet. The bredth conſiſteth of Windowes, Doores, Gates, Shoppes, and ſuch like things. The height conſiſteth of Portes, Windowes, Iettings, Cornices, Columnes, Rooffes, and ſuch like things. But there is yet another, that is of the thickeneſſe of the Walles, Pillars, Columnes and Pilaiſters: The length is taken from the ſhortening Quadrants, and from thence alſo you take the bredth. But the height is taken out of the bredth in the Quadrants, which bredth muſt be taken from the Quadran or halfe Quadran, which toucheth it on the hithermoſt fide as it ſtandeth: as alſo from the hithermoſt doore, which is ten foote high, there you muſt take the meaſure from the Quadrans, which come to the Paralels on the nethermoſt corner or poynt of the doore; for if there you take fiue Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drans in bredth, it ſhall be height within the Antipagementum. And that which I haue ſayd of theſe doores, you muſt alſo vnderſtand of all the other things: The thickeneſſe of the Wall is two foote, for you ſee it containeth a Quadrant. The bearing euer of the ſecond Houſe is of ſixe foote, meaſured vpon the ground: the like alſo the bearing oner or ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the firſt Houſe containeth. To conclude all things, as I haue ſaid, riſing out of the ground on all ſides, I haue ſet no Cornices, nor any other ornaments in this Figure, that you may the eaſier vnderſtand it; but a man of ripe iudgement and vnderſtanding knowing the terminations, can by his owne inuention helpe himſelfe to make faire Buildings. And for that I may not ſpend too much time herein, I will make others to giue you more light therein.</p>

                     <p>THE Stayres, degrées or goings vp, are very neceſſary in Buildings, and therefore I will ſhew diuers kinds thereof, and firſt I will begin with the eaſieſt. According to common cuſtome a Stayre or ſtep is about halfe a foote high, and about a foote broad vpon the ſtep; then let the ſquare ſtones of this ground be a foote ſquare, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with we will make a paire of ſtaires of fiue foote high, and thrée foote broad: at the foote of the ground wee will take the meaſure of the bredth, which both on the right and left ſides ſhall be ſet in Perpendicular lines on the Corners of the Stayres, which ſhall be deuided into ten, as the lines <hi>A. B.</hi> ſhew you. Then all the parts of <hi>A. B.</hi> ſhall be raiſed to the Horiſon, and then you ſhall take nine Quadrantes vpwards in length: and where as two lines are ſet vp cutting through the Horiſental lines of <hi>A. B.</hi> there the corners <hi>D. C.</hi> of the vppermoſt ſteps ſhalbe, containing a foure ſquare of thrée Quadrants on each ſide. From the hithermoſt points of the ſame vpperſteps, you ſhal draw two helding lines to the loweſt ſteps; againſt the which the Horiſentall and the Perpendicular lines of the Quadran ſhall come together and ſhut vp the Stayres.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Stayres are ſhortened on the one ſide, and the other is plaine or profil, and containeth a ſtep leſſe in the height, which maketh foure foote and a halfe; it is alſo thrée foote broad, as it is marked vnder it on the ground. By this rule you may make Stayres or degrées as high as you will, and make ſome reſting places in the way: alwayes taking the meaſure from the foote of the ground, as well of the ſhortening, as of thoſe that are vpright.</p>

                     <p>THE going vp being plaine or profil maketh a great ſhow, and yet are very eaſie to ſet in all places, I meane in the turning, and may ſerue for many things, ſpecially in Buildings, where a man going vp ſoftly and with eaſe, giueth the beholders a kind of pleaſure to view them, principally in common places, for that there is a going vp on eyther ſide, ſo that vpon the one ſide men may goe vp, and on the other ſide they may goe downe; and although there are only but two goings vp, yet by this a man by his own inuention may deuiſe others. How theſe Stayres are made, and with what reaſon, you may by the Figure perceaue them, although I ſhould ſay nothing thereof: for as it is ſayd before, the Quadrants are of a foote broad, and the ſteps halfe a foot high, and ſo the bredth of the ſtep is one foot. The bredth of the Stayres is fiue foote, both the firſt and ſecond: The reſting gate containeth in wideneſſe thrée foote, and is ſixe foote high; which although it ſeemeth to be ſhut, and a ſmall doore opening in it: yet it may be made whole open and otherwiſe cloſed. The two ſides aboue the thrée ſteps are fiue foote broad, although here it is but one foote, becauſe of the narrowneſſe of the Paper. The Perpendicular lines on the ſides, ſignifie leaning places, and they ſhould ſerue well alſo to the ſteps, but leſt they ſhould comber the worke, I haue leſt them out.</p>

                     <p>AMongſt other things which ſhow well in Perſpectiue worke, I finde that goings vp or ſteps are very ſée mely, and the ottner that they turne, the better they ſhew; therefore I haue made theſe two goings vp turning, which ſtand in profil, yet you ſée the ground and the ſteps. This firſt going vp is ſixe foote high and three foote broad, as you may ſée it marked in the ground with pricks: the reſting place betwéene the firſt and ſecond going vp, is two foure ſquares long, which is neceſſary, becauſe of the turning. At the end thereof you finde a Portale, the dore thereof is two foote wyde, the Antipagmentum is halfe a foote on eyther ſide, ſo that the place is three footefull. The Perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicular lines on the right ſide of the plaine, ſignifie certaine leanings, which may bee made of Iron, Wood, or Stone; the like may be made along the Stayres both vpward and downeward, ſetting a Baluſter vpon euery Stayre: The height of this raile or leaning, ſhall be two foote and an halfe; for ſo it is caſie to lay a mans hand vpon. How theſe Stayres are made vpwards out of the ground, although it may well be ſéene by the Figure without declaring it: yet I will ſay ſome thing thereof, to eaſe them that are ſhort of memory. The reſting gate or round doore vnder the plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe betweene the ſecond and the third going vp, is no deeper then to the wall: Aboue the ſame doore there ſtandeth an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other going vp, of foure ſteps, which to make, I haue ſufficiently ſhewed; otherwiſe a man ſhould continue the ground at the reſting doore, to draw them vp from it.</p>

The two Arches vnder the two goings vp are each a foot in thickeneſſe, whereby a go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing downe is foure foote within, and is alſo drawen out of the ground as the reſt are. The other goings vp, which you ſée through the Arches; you may ſufficiently perceiue by them how they are made: and ſo it is with the two paire of Stayres on the left hand, for from the firſt ſteps at the reſting doore, you may eaſily ſée how they are rayſed vp out of the ground, and aboue at the end of them they haue a piece of plaine ground to come to the other Stayres, which alſo is drawne vp out of the pauement as the reſt are, that is, each ſtep halfe a foote high, and a foote broad. But it is hard to meaſure in ſo ſmall things, but it ſuffiſeth that hereby you may ſee the manner thereof: and when you make them great you ſhall find that they will come well inough to paſſe. Vnder the Stayres laſt named, there ſtandeth alſo a round doore which is fiue foot wyde: vpon this ground, and on theſe Stayres a cunning Paynter might place diuers Figures in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall formes, eyther ſtanding or ſitting vpon the Stayres; and lying vpon the ground in ſhortening manner, and that in this wiſe: You may place the Figures where you will with féete, and then take ſixe féete or ſquares whereon they ſtand, and that ſhal be their height, for that it is the height of a common or ordinary man: this you muſt obſerue both before and behind, and in euery place. If the Figure be vpon a ſtep, then take the meaſure of that ſtep whereon it ſtandeth, and make it twelue ſteps high, which ſhall be fire foote: And is the Figure lying, doe the like; but if it lieth in ſhortening manner vpon the ground, then you muſt take the length by the ſhortening Quadrant.</p>

The firſt ſhall be winding Stayres in foure ſquare, and he that can make theſe foure ſquare Stayres, may well make the round Stayres, for it is all one thing, ſpecially if he vſeth the rule before ſet downe of the round bodies.</p>
                     <p>The Figure <hi>P.</hi> is the ground of this winding Stayre, but it is much leſſe then the vppermoſt to get ground. This foure ſquare ground in ſhortening you muſt make halfe a foote high, which ſhalbe for the firſt ſtep. Then before at either end, you muſt make a Perpendicular line vpright, and in it make as many halfe féete as you deſire to make the Stayres high; you muſt alſo place the like Perpendicular lines betwéene the middle, &amp; the corners: then you muſt draw the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations both on the right and the left ſides vpwards to the Horiſon, which muſt cut through the Perpendicular lines, which are drawne out of the terminations of the ſteps; and of the ſame height that the two cornerd Perpendicular lines are: and of the ſame meaſure you muſt make the other two Perpendicular lines betwéene the corners and the middle. Then in the middlemoſt termination of the ground you muſt place an other Perpendicular line, and deuide it alſo in halfe féet, as the other Perpendicular line on the ſide is: So out of this Perpendicular line of the Centers againſt the néereſt Perpendicular line beneath on the left hand, you muſt frame the firſt ſtep with two lines: The ſecond ſtep you ſhal alſo frame and ſhut vp out of the Perpendicular line of the Centers in the corner following. Then from that poynt or corner you muſt draw a line to the Horiſon, which againſt the ſecond Perpendicular line will make the termination of the third ſtep, which ſhall alſo bee ſhut about, according to the aforeſaid rule: from that poynt or corner of the ſtep you muſt alſo make an Hor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

And when that ſtep is alſo cloſed with lines: then you muſt draw the poynt towards the Horiſon, which line will ſhew you the termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of the ſirt ſtep againſt the hindermoſt Perpendicular line: and that being alſo cloſed vp with liues, then out of the ſame corner you muſt draw a Pararel line to the termination of the ſeuenth ſtep, and no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

Theſe Stayres muſt thus bee made. Firſt, you muſt make a foure ſquare ſhortening body of halfe a foot high, vpon this you muſt draw two Diagonall lines, and from the corner inwards there ſhall be a foote broad left on eyther ſide, and the terminations thereof drawne to the Horiſon, and ſo from the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonall lines you ſhall ſee the corners of the ſecond ſtep. Now I need not ſet downe vnto you how you ſhall finde the leſſening corner of the ſecond ſtep, the which is round about ſhut vp with Paralel and Horiſentall lines: then vpon the ſecond plaine you muſt draw two Diagenall lines, which doing (as I ſayd before) will ſhew you the third ſtep; which alſo being cloſed vp with lines, you ſhall alſo find the fourth and fifth, with the like rules: This Piramides is fantaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally framed vpon them to fill vp the place. Alſo I need not ſet down to what vſes theſe Stayres may ſerue, for that the halfe of them is commonly found in diuers pieces of worke, as the gates of Pallaces, Churches, and other dwelling Houſes, and the aſcending vp to Altars: By this way alſo you may make round Stayres; and alſo Stayres of ſixe or eyght corners, as by their formes I haue ſhewed.</p>

Now you ſee how the Cornices ſtand without the foure ſquare body: but this is only for Cornices that are made without members, not to comber you with the ſhadowing of them, for I will ſpeake of them hereafter particulerly.</p>

There are ſome Cornices which reach ſo farre ouer, that men can not ſee the members thereof vnder them; therefore in that caſe the members are ſo to be made, that they may be ſeemely and pleaſant in mens ſight.</p>

                     <p>THe foure Figures aforeſayd haue their diſtances equally broad from the Horiſon, that is, as much on the one ſide as the other; but the Figure following is of an other manner: ſo that the Horiſental lines ſerue both for diſtances. To vnderſtand it, begin thus: Firſt, the Baſe <hi>A.B.</hi> is made and is placed in foure equall parts, as <hi>C.D.E.</hi> the lines <hi>C.D.</hi> are drawne on the right hand towards the Horiſon, and the lines <hi>A.C.</hi> are drawne towards the Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon on the left ſide, which forme a perfect ſhortening foure ſquare; which foure ſquare you ſee more on the one ſide, then on the other. The foure points or corners of theſe foure ſquare things, are <hi>F.G.H.C.</hi> If you deuide theſe foure ſquare things in two parts, then you muſt deuide the Baſe <hi>D.E.</hi> in two parts, and the terminations thereof being drawne to the right ſide, there you ſhall finde the halfe of your foure ſquare marked with two Stars. But if you will lengthen it an other halfe foure ſquare, then draw a termination <hi>E.</hi> to the right Horiſon, the lines at <hi>I.K.</hi> the other halfe foure ſquare, ſo that theſe Superficies ſhall be of two perfect foure corners: And this will ſerue the ingenious workeman for many things, which I will not here ſet downe for breuitie ſake.</p>

                     <p>THis body hereafter following is rayſed vp out of the former Figure before ſet downe, and is made with the ſame Horiſon; which body containeth two Quadrants in length, &amp; one Quadrant in height, for the line <hi>C.D.</hi> is ſet in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular maner vpon the nethermoſt corner, wheron the other Superficies are ſet: thus then this body is of two foureſquares, I meane two foure ſquares in length, and one foure ſquare broad and high. And this body (as I ſaid before) ſhall ſerue for many things: But if you will haue more cubits in the length, then lengthen the Baſe in ſo many parts more, and you ſhall alwayes finde the trueth hereof. And if you will make a border or creaſt about this body, then you muſt follow this rule aforeſayd.</p>

The croſſe made vpon this ground is onely to ſhow you the way and entry thereunto; but for ſuch a forme, you may make a forme of a Chriſtian Church as they are now built. The other forme by it, ſheweth a piece of a foundation of a Houſe, but all theſe things you may make in a greater forme, and ſet them forth as you will; ſometime placing the Horiſentall lines in ſuch manner that you may ſee more of the out ſides, but yet the Horiſons muſt ſtand all of one height.</p>

But becauſe that this eyght ſquare columne is too much ſéene on the ſides, the readier to make it out of the foure ſquare: I haue therefore made an other piece by it, the which, becauſe it draweth neerer to this Horiſon, is ſéene more before, then the other, although not ſo long; for it is but halfe ſo long as the other, as you may ſée &amp; tell it in the ground or foot thereof.

And if I had not vndertaken to ſhow other things of more importance, I would haue drawne diuers bodies and houſes after this manner. But for that I meane to entreat of Scenes, and the preparing of places for to ſhow Comedies and Tragedies, which is now vſed in this age, and ſpecially in <hi>Italy,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I will make an end of theſe foure cornerd things, leauing it to another (as I ſayd before) to ſet foorth more thereof.</p>

In the which Scenes it will bee very hard for a man to ſhew how, &amp; where a man ſhould place the Horiſon herein, becauſe it is an other thing then the rule before declared: Therfore I thought it good firſt to make this profil, that the ground by the profill may both together be the better vnderſtood; yet it were conuenient firſt to ſtudie the ground, and if it ſo falleth out that a man cannot attaine to all within the ground, then hee muſt procéede to th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

There you may ſée the bright ſhining Moone aſcending only with her hornes, and already riſen vp, before the ſpectators are ware of, or once ſaw it aſcend. In ſome other Scenes you may ſée the riſing of the Sunne with his courſe about the world: and at the ending of the Comedie, you may ſee it goe downe moſt artificially, where at many beholders haue bene abaſht.

But for that we are entred into another maner of Perſpectiue worke, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I will ſpeake more at large thereof. This Perſpectiue worke wherof I wil ſpeake, although it be contrary to thoſe rules which are ſhewed before, becauſe theſe aforeſayd are imagined to be vpon a ſlat wall: and this other rule becauſe it is materiall and imboſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed or rayſed outward, therefore it is reaſon we obſerue another rule therein, according to common cuſtome. Firſt, you muſt make a Scaffold, which muſt bee as high as a mans eye will reach, looking directly for ward; for the firſt part thereof which is marked <hi>C.</hi> But the other part behind it, whereon the Houſes ſtand, you muſt rayſe vp behind againſt the wall at leaſt a ninth part thereof, that is, you muſt deuide the playne Stage or Scaffold in nine parts; and then you muſt make the Scaffold higher by a ninth part behind: then before at <hi>B.</hi> which muſt be very euen &amp; ſtrong becauſe of the Moriſed dancers. This hanging downward of the Scaffold, I haue found by experience to be very pleaſing, for in <hi>Vincente</hi> which is as ſumptuous and rich a Towne as any in all <hi>Italy;</hi> there I made a Theater and a Stage of wood, then the which, I thinke, there was neuer a greater made in our time, in regard of the wonderfull ſights that there were ſcene, as of Wagons, Elephants and other Moriſcoes. There I ordained, that before the hanging Scene there ſhould be a Scaffold made by water compaſſe, which Scaffold was <hi>12.</hi> foot broad, and <hi>60.</hi> foot long, according to the place wherin it ſtood; which I found to be very pleaſing and fit for ſhew. This firſt Scaffold, becauſe it was right, therefore the pauement therof muſt not obey the Horiſon, but the Quadrants, whereof on euery ſide were foure ſquare, from whence at the beginning of the riſing Scaffold <hi>B.</hi> all the Quadrans went to the outtermoſt Horiſon <hi>O.</hi> which with their due diſtances do ſhorten very well.

                        <p>And becauſe the preparation for Comedies are done in thrée ſorts, that is, Comical, Tragical and Satiricall; I will firſt entreat of the Comicall, whereof the Houſes muſt be made as if they were for common or ordinarie people, which for the moſt part muſt be made vnder roofes in a Hall, which at the end thereof hath a chamber for the pleaſure or eaſe of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> perſonages: and there it is that the ground of the Scaffold is made (as I ſaid and ſhewed before) in the profil. Therefore <hi>C.</hi> is the firſt part being the flat Scaffold; and ſuppoſe that each Quadran containeth two foote on eyther ſide, ſo ſhal they vpon the hanging Scaffold before on the Baſe be alſo two foot broad, which is marked <hi>B.</hi> And (as I ſayd before) my meaning is not to place the Horiſon hereof againſt the backe behind in the Scaffold, but as farre as it is from the beginning of the pauement <hi>B.</hi> to the wall, ſo farre I would alſo that men ſhall paſſe behinde through the wall, and ſo ſhall all the houſes and other things ſhow better in the ſhortening: and when by conuenient diſtances you haue drawne all the Quadrans towards the Horiſon, &amp; ſhortened them, then you muſt ſhorten the houſes right with the foure ſquare ſtones; which houſes are the great lines marked vpon the ground, aſwell for thoſe that ſtand vpright, as thoſe that ſhorten. All ſuch houſes I alwayes made of ſpars, or rafter or laths, couered with linnin cloth; making doores and windowes, both before and in the ſhortening, as occaſion fell out. I haue alſo made ſome things of halfe planks of wood, which were great helpe to the Paynters to ſet out things at life. All the ſpaces fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the backe to the wall marked <hi>A.</hi> ſhall be for the perſonages, to the which end the hindermoſt backe in the middle ſhall ſtand at the leaſt two foot from the wall, that the perſonages may goe from the one ſide to the other, and not be ſéene. Then you muſt rayſe a termination at the beginning of the pauement <hi>B.</hi> which ſhall be the poynt <hi>L.</hi> and from thence to the Horiſon there ſhalbe a line drawne, as it is marked in the profil with prickes, which ſhall be of like height; and where that toucheth the hindermoſt backe of the Scene or Scaffold, there the Horiſon of that backe ſhall ſtand: and that Horiſon ſhall ſerue onely for that backe. But if you ſtretch a corde or any other thing to the termination <hi>L.</hi> then you may faſten a thread to it, to thruſt backward or forward, to vſe it out of the ſtedfaſt Horiſon, &amp; all the Ortographie of the houſes before. But the Horiſon which goeth through the wall, ſhall ſerue for all the ſhortening ſides of the houſes: and for that men ſhould breake the wall, if they would vſe all this Horiſon in groſſe, which may not bee done, therefore I haue alwayes made a ſmall modell of wood and Paper iuſt of the ſame bignes, and by the ſame modell ſet it downe in groſſe, from piece to piece. But this way will fall out hard for ſome men to vnderſtand, neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, it will be neceſſary to worke by models and experiments, and by ſtudie a man ſhall ſind the way: and for that a man can hardly finde any Halls how great ſoeuer, wherein he can place a Theater without imperfection and impediment; therefore to follow Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities, according to my power and abilitie, I haue made all ſuch parts of theſe Theaters, as may ſtand in a Hall.

                        <p>TOuching the diſpoſiton of Theaters and other Scenes, concerning the grounds thereof, I haue ſpoken ſufficiently; now I will ſpeake of the Scene in Perſpectiue worke: and for that Scenes are made of thrée ſorts, that is, Comical, to play Comedies on, Tragicall, for Tragedies, and Satiricall for Satirs. This firſt ſhall be Comicall, whereas the houſes muſt be flight for Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, but ſpecially there muſt not want a brawthell or bawdy houſe, and a great Inne, and a Church; ſuch things are of neceſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to be therein. How to rayſe theſe houſes from the ground is ſufficiently expreſſed, and how you ſhall place the Horiſon: neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe, that you may be the better inſtructed (touching the former of theſe houſes) I haue here ſet downe a Figure, for ſatiſfaction of thoſe that take pleaſure therein; but becauſe this Figure is ſo ſmall, therein I could not obſerue all the meaſures, but refer them to inuention, that thereby you may chuſe or make houſes which ſhew well, as an open Gallery, or lodge through the which you may ſée an other houſe. The hangings ouer or ſhooting out, ſhow well in ſhortening worke, and ſome Cornices cut out at the ends; accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with ſome others that are painted, ſhow well in worke: ſo doe the houſes which haue great bearing out, like lodgings or Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

The windowes which ſtand before, were good to be made of Glaſſe or Paper, with light behind them. But if I ſhould here write all that I know to ſerue for this worke, it would be ouerlong to rehearſe; therefore I referre that to the wit and diſcretion of thoſe that exerciſe and practiſe themſelue<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>HOuſes for Tragedies, muſt bee made for great perſonages, for that actions of loue, ſtrange aduentures, and cruell murthers, (as you reade in ancient and moderne Tragedies) happen alwayes in the houſes of great Lords, Dukes, Princes, and Kings. Therefore in ſuch caſes you muſt make none but ſtately houſes, as you ſée it hore in this Figure; wherein (for that it is ſo ſmal) I could make no Princely Pallaces: but it is ſufficient for the workeman to ſée the manner thereof, whereby he may helpe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe as time and place ſerueth: and (as I ſayde in the Comicall) hee muſt alwayes ſtudy to pleaſe the eyes of the beholders, and forget not himſelfe ſo much as to ſet a ſmall building in ſtead of a great, for the reaſons aforeſayd. And for that I haue made all my Scenes of laths, couered with linnen, yet ſometime it is neceſſary to make ſome things riſing or boſſing out; which are to bee made of wood, like the houſes on the left ſide, whereof the Pillars, although they ſhorten, ſtand all vpon one Baſe, with ſome ſtayres, all co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered ouer with cloth, the Cornices bearing out, which you muſt obſerue to the middle part: But to giue place to the Galleries, you muſt ſet the other ſhortening Cloth ſomewhat backwards, and make a cornice aboue it, as you ſee: and that which I ſpeake of theſe Buildings, you muſt vnderſtand of all the reſt, but in the Buildings which ſtand far backward the Painting worke, muſt ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie the place by ſhadowes without any bearing out: touching the artificiall lights, I haue ſpoken thereof in the Comicall works. All that you make aboue the Roofe ſticking out, as Chimneyes, Towers, Piramides, Obliſces, and other ſuch like things or Images; you muſt make them all of thin bords, cut out round, and well colloured: But if you make any flat Buildings, they muſt ſtand ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what farre inward, that you may not ſee them on the ſides. In theſe Scenes, although ſome haue painted perſonages therein like ſupporters, as in a Gallery, or doore, as a Dog, Cat, or any other beaſts: I am not of that opinion, for that ſtandeth too long without ſtirring or moouing; but if you make ſuch a thing to lie ſléeping, that I hold withall. You may alſo make Images, Hiſtories, or Fables of Marble, or other matter againſt a wall; but to repreſent the life, they ought to ſtirre. In the latter end of this Booke I will ſhew you how to make them.</p>

                        <p>THe Satiricall Scenes are to repreſent Satirs, wherein you muſt place all thoſe things that bee rude and ruſticall, as in ancient Satire they were made plaine without any reſpect, whereby men might vnderſtand, that ſuch things were referred to Ruſh call people, which ſet all things out rudely and plainely: for which cauſe <hi>Vitruuius</hi> ſpeaking of Scenes, ſaith, they ſhould be made with Trées, Rootes, Herbs, Hils and Flowres, and with ſome countrey houſes, as you ſée them here ſet downe. And for that in our dayes theſe things were made in Winter, when there were but fewe gréene Trées. Herbs and Flowres to be found; then you muſt make theſe things of Silke, which will be more commendable then the naturall things themſelues: and as in other Scenes for Comedies or Tragedies, the houſes or other artificiall things are painted, ſo you muſt make Trées, Hearbs, and other things in theſe; &amp; the more ſuch things coſt, the more they are eſteemed, for they are things which ſtately and great perſons doe, which are ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to nigardlineſſe.

I ſpeake not of Satirs, Nimphes, Mer-maids, diuers monſters, and other ſtrange beaſtes, made ſo cunningly, that they ſéemed in ſhew as if they went and ſtirred, according to their manner. And if I were not deſirous to be briefs, I would ſpeake of the coſtly apparel of ſome Shepheards made of cloth of gold, and of Silke, cunningly mingled with Imbrothery: I would alſo ſpeake of ſome Fiſhermen, which were no leſſe richly apparelled then the others, hauing Nets and Angling-rods, all gilr: I ſhould ſpeake of ſome Countrey mayds and Nimphes careleſly apparelled without pride, but I leaue all theſe things to the diſcretion and conſideration of the indicious workeman; which ſhall make all ſuch things as their paitcons ſerue them, which they muſt worke after their owne deuiſes, and neuer take care what it ſhall coſt.</p>

Take a piece of Salamoniacke, and put it into a Barbers Baſen, or ſuch like thing, and put water into it: then bruſe and cruſh the Salamoniacke ſoftly therein, till it be all molten, alwayes putting more water vnto it, as you deſire to haue it light or ſad collour; which done, if you will haue it fayre and cleare, then ſtraine it through a fine cloth into an other veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, and then it will be a cleare Celeſtiall blew, whereof you may make diuers kinds of blew with water. Will you make an Emerauld collour, then put ſome Saffron as you will haue it pale or high colloured; for heere it is not neceſſary to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe you any weight or meaſure, for that experience will teach you bow to doe it. If you will make a Rubbie collour, if you bee in a place where you may haue red Wine. then you néed not vſe any other thing; but to make it pall with water, us need requireth: but if you can get no wine, then take Brazill beaten to powder, &amp; put it into a Kettell of water with Allum, let it ſéethe, and ſkum it well; then ſtrayne it, and vſe it with water and Vinneger. If you will counterfeit a Ballayes, you muſt make it of red and white Wine mingled together; but white Wine alone will ſhowe like a Topas or a Criſolite? The Conduit or common water being ſtrayned, will be like a Diamond, and to doe this well, you muſt vpon a glaſſie ground frame certaine points or tablets, and fill them with wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. The manner to ſet theſe ſhining collours in their places, in thus, Behind the painted houſe wherein theſe painted collours ſhall ſtand, you muſt ſet a thin board, cut out in the ſame manner that theſe lights ſhall be placed, whether it be round or ſquare, cornerd or o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

And behind the glaſſes you muſt ſet great Lampes, that the light may alſo be ſtedfaſt: and if the bottels or other veſſels of glaſſe on the ſide where the light ſtands were flat, or rather hollow, it would ſhow the clearer, and the collours moſt excellent and fayre; the like muſt be done with the holes on the ſhortening ſide: But if you néed a great light to ſhow more then the reſt, then ſet a torch behind, and behind the torch a bright Baſon; the brightnes whereof will ſhew like the beames of the Sunne. You may alſo make glaſſe of all collours and formes, ſome foure ſquare, ſome with croſſes, &amp; any other forme with their light behind them. Now all the lights ſeruing for the collours, ſhal not be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame which muſt light the Scene, for you muſt haue a great number of torches before the Scene. You may alſo place certaine candleſtickes aboue the Scene with great candles therein, and aboue the candleſticks you may place ſome veſſels with water, wherein you may put a piece of Camphir, which burning, will ſhow a very good light, and ſmell well. Sometime it may chance that you muſt make ſome thing or other which ſhould ſéeme to burne, which you muſt wet throughly with excellent good Aquauite; and ſetting it on fire with a candle it will burne all ouer: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I could ſpeake more of theſe fires, yet this ſhal ſuffice for this time; &amp; I will ſpeake of ſome things that are pleaſing to the behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. The while that the Scene is emptie of perſonages, then the workman muſt haue certaine Figures or formes ready of ſuch great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes as the place where they muſt ſtand, will afford them to be, which muſt be made of paſſe board, cut out round and paynted, ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch things as you will, which Figures muſt leane againſt a rule or lath of wood, croſſe ouer the Scene where any gate, doore, or way is made, and there ſome one or other behind the doore muſt make the. Figures paſſe along, ſometime in forme of Muſitions with inſtruments, and ſome like ſingers; and behind the Scene ſome muſt play on, vpon certaine inſtruments and ſing alſo: ſometime you muſt make a number of foote men and horſemen going about with Trumpets, Phifes and Drummes, at which time you muſt play with Drumbes, Trumpets and Phifes, &amp;c. very ſoftly behind, which will kéepe the peoples eyes occupied, and content them well. If it be requiſite to make a Planet or any other thing to paſſe along in the Ayre, it muſt bee framed and cut out of paſte-board; then in the hindermoſt and backe part of the houſes of the Scene, there muſt be a piece of wire drawne aboue in the roofe of the houſe and made faſt with certain rings behind to the paſte-board painted with a Planet or any other thing that ſhalbe drawne ſoftly by a man with a blacke thréed from one end to the other, but it muſt be farre from mens ſight, that neither of the thréeds may bee ſéene. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time you ſhall haue occaſion to ſhew thunder and lightning as the play requireth; then you muſt make thunder in this manner: com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly all Scenes are made at the end of a great Hall, whereas vſually there is a Chamber aboue it, wherein you muſt roule a great Bullet of a Cannon or of ſome other great Ordinance, and then counterfeit Thunder. Lightning muſt be made in this maner, there muſt be a man placed behind the Scene or Scaffold in a high place with a boxe in his hand, the couer whereof muſt be full with holes, and in the middle of that place there ſhall be a burning candle placed, the boxe muſt be filled with powder of vernis or ſulphire, and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting his hand with the boxe vpwards the powder flying in the candle, will ſhew as if it were lightning. But touching the beames of the lightning, you muſt draw a piece of wyre ouer the Scene, which muſt hang downewards, whereon you muſt put a ſquib cone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ouer with pure gold or ſhining lattin which you will: and while the Bullet is rouling, you muſt ſhoote of ſome piece of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, and with the ſame giuing fire to the ſquibs, it will worke the effect which is deſired. It would be ouerlong if I ſhould ſpeake of all things which are to be vſed in theſe affaires, therefore I will leaue ſpeaking of Perſpectiue things.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Mong all the ancient building to bee ſeene in Rome, I am of opinion, that the Pantheon (for one piece of worke alone) is the fayreſt, wholeſt, and beſt to be vnderſtood; and is ſo much the more wonderfull then the reſt, becauſe it hath ſo many members, which are all ſo correſpondent one to the other, that whoſoeuer beholdeth it, taketh great pleaſure therein, which proceedeth from this, that the excellent workeman, which inuented it, choſe the perfiteſt forme, that is, the round forme, whereby it is vſually called, Our Lady of the Round: for within, it is as high as it is broad. And it may be, that the ſayd workeman, conſidering, that all things proceeding orderly, haue a principall and onely head, whereon the nether parts depend, was of opinion, that this piece of worke ſhould haue onely but one light, and that, in the higheſt part thereof, that it might ſpread abroad in all places alike, as in effect you ſee it doth: for beſides other things which haue their perfect light, there are ſixe Chappels, which (for that they ſtand within the thickneſſe of the wall) ſhould be darke, yet they haue their due light, by the meanes of ſome drawing windowes, aboue in the top of the ſayd Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels, which giue them ſecond light, taken from the vppermoſt hole, ſo that there is not any ſmall thing in them, but it receiueth a part of the light, (and this is not made without great iudgement:) for this Temple, in old time, being dedicated to all the gods, by which meanes there ſtood many Images in it, (which the diuers Tabernacles, Seates, and ſmall windowes ſhew) it was neceſſary that euery one had his due light. Wherefore ſuch as take pleaſure to make Images, and other imboſſed or grauen worke, muſt conſider, that ſuch a Cabinet ſhould haue his light from aboue, that euery one, ſtanding in his place, neede not looke for light to ſee, but that they may bee ſeene altogether at one time. But to come to my firſt ſpeach: For that the Pantheon ſeemeth vnto me to be the perfecteſt peece of worke that euer I ſaw, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I thought it good to ſet it firſt in the beginning of this Booke, and for a principall head of all other peeces of worke. The founder of this Temple (as <hi>Plinie</hi> writeth in more then one place) was <hi>Marcus Agrippa,</hi> to accompliſh <hi>Auguſtus Caeſars</hi> laſt will, who being intercepted by death, could not finiſh it: and ſo it was built about foureteene yeeres after the byrth of our Lord, which is about 5203. yeeres from the beginning of the world.</p>
                     <p>In this Temple (as <hi>Pliny</hi> writeth) the Capitals were of Copper; and hee writeth alſo, that <hi>Diogenes,</hi> the Image-maker of Athens, made the excellent Caracters in the Pillars, and that the Images placed aboue the Fronteſpicium were much commended, although by the highneſſe of the place they could not be ſo well diſcerned. This Temple was conſumed with lightening, and burnt, about the 12. yeere of the raigne of the Emperour <hi>Traian,</hi> which was about 113. yeeres after the byrth of Chriſt, and in the 5311. yeere of the creation of the world: and <hi>Lucius Septimus Seuerus,</hi> and <hi>Marcus Aurelius Antonius,</hi> repayred it agayne, with all the Ornaments thereto belonging, as it appeareth in the Architraue of the ſayd frame: which Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments, you muſt preſume, were all new made, otherwiſe the Caracters of <hi>Diogenes</hi> would ſtill haue bene ſeene there. But in truth, the workman that made it, was very iudicious and conſtant; for that he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned the members thereof very iudiciouſly to the body, and would not ſuppreſſe the worke with many cuttings: but as I will ſhew, when time ſerueth, how to place and deuide them excellent well. Alſo, in all the worke, hee hath obſerued the worke of Corinth, and would mixe no other with it: and withall, the meaſures of all the members are as well obſerued as euer I ſaw or meaſured in any other peece of worke, whereby we may call this Temple an example of workemanſhip. But leauing this matter (for that it giueth the workeman little, or no inſtruction to the purpoſe) I will proceede to the particular mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures: and that I may goe forward orderly in theſe Antiquities, the firſt Figure ſhall be the Ichnography. The ſecond, the Orthography. The third, the Sciography.</p>

                     <p>This Figure following is the Ichnography, that is, the ground of the Temple aforeſayd, which is meaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the ancient, or old Romiſh Palmes placed along by the ſide hereof. And firſt, ſpeaking of the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, whereof the Columnes are 6. Palmes &amp; 29. minutes thicke. The Intercolumnes (which are the ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces from one Columne to another) are 8. Palmes and 9. minutes: the breadth of the Portall is 40. Palmes: the breadth of the flat Pillars of the Portall, is like the Diameter of the Columnes: the breadth of the Seates betweene the Pillars, is 10. Palmes: and the Pilaſters on the ſides are 2. Palmes: the wideneſſe of the Gates is 26. Palmes and a halfe: the wideneſſe of the whole Temple (that is, of the Floore within, from one wall to another) is 194. Palmes: and iuſt ſo much is the height from the Floore to the vndermoſt ſtone of the window aboue. The ſayd round hole is 36. Palmes and a halfe broad: each of the ſixe Chappels that are made within the thickneſſe of the wall, are 26. Palmes, and 30. minutes; and goe halfe as deepe into the wall as the thickneſſe of the foure ſquare Pillars on each ſide. But the principall Chappell is thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie Palmes broad, and alſo is an halfe Circle, beſides the Pillars aforeſayd. The thickneſſe of the Columnes of all the Chappels, is 5. Palmes, 3. minutes leſſe: the foure ſquare corner Pillars alſo of the ſayd Chappels, contayning as much. The Columnes of the Tabernacle betweene the Chappels are two Palmes thicke: the thickneſſe of the wall that goeth round about the whole body of the Temple, is 31. Palmes. And although that the Chappels make the walles hollow, yet betweene them there are hollow places made within the walles, which ſome ſay, were left for places to receiue wind, becauſe of earthquakes. But I am of opinion, that they were left ſo vnfilled, to ſpare ſtuffe, becauſe they are made circlewiſe, and are ſtrong inough. The going vp, which you ſee here on the left ſide, was alſo on the right ſide, to go vp the Portall: men alſo went from thence round about the Temple, ouer the Chappels, through a ſecret way, which is yet there: through the which alſo, they went without on the ſteps, to clime vp into the higheſt parts of the buildings, with many goings vp which are round about it. It is thought, that this foundation was all one maſſe or lumpe, and without, many places hollow, ſo that ſome neighbours marking it, and ſeeking to build, haue found ſuch a foundation when they digged.</p>
                     <p>This is the old Romiſh Palme, which is deuided into twelue fingers, and each finger is deuided into foure parts, which are called Minutes, by the which meaſure this preſent Figure, with all the parts following, was meaſured.</p>

                        <p>THE Figure hereunder, ſheweth the whole forme of the Pantheon right before, and although at this time men go downe into it by certaine ſteps; yet as it was made at the firſt it was ſeuen ſteps aboue the ground. It is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that ſuch and ſo old a piece of worke is yet whole and ſtanding ſtill, for that the foundation was not ſparingly made; for it is thought that it was once as broad againe vnder as it is aboue, as it had beene found by the neighbour workemen: but let vs proceed to the particular meaſure thereof from the earth vpwards. I ſayd before, that the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Columens of the Portal is ſixe Palmes &amp; nine and twenty minutes, but the height is foure and fiftie Palmes and nine and twentie minutes, without the Baſes and Capitals: the Baſes are thrée Palmes and ninetéene minutes high, and the Capitals ſeuen Palmes and ſeuen and thirtie minutes high; the height of the Architrane is fiue Palmes, the Fréeſe is fiue Palmes and thirtéene minutes high; the Cornice is foure Palmes and nine minutes high, aboue from the top or Scina of the Cornice, to the poynt of the Geuell, are foure and thirtie Palmes, and nine and thirtie minutes. The Timpanum, that is, the flat part of the Gewell, is thought to haue bene adorned with ſiluer images, althought it is not ſet downe in writing; but conſidering the great power of ſuch Emperors, I am perſwaded that it was ſo, for if the Goathes, Wandals, or other nations (which ſpoyled <hi>Rome</hi> more then once) had beene deſirous or couetous of Copper, they might haue taken it from the Architraues and other Ornamento in Portals in great abundance: but let it be as it will, there are Figures and tokens ſéene, which ſhew that there were Figures and tokens of Mettall ſtanding thereon.</p>

                        <p>THis Figure following ſheweth the Pantheon within, which forme (as I ſaid) is taken from Sphera, becauſe it is ſo wide from one wall vnto the other, as it is high from the Pauement to the open place vpon the top thereof; which wideneſſe and height are both a hundred ninetie and foure Palmes vpwards, from the Pauement to the higheſt; and from the Cornice to the higheſt part of the roofe is alſo the ſame meaſure, that is, each the halfe of one hundred ninetie and foure Palmes. The Quadrants in the roofe are all like that in the middle; and it is thought that they were alſo beautified ouer with Siluer plate by certaine remnants thereof yet remayning to be ſeene: for if they had beene of Copper, they would yet be ſéene there, or elſe thoſe ouer the Portals would alſo haue beene taken away.</p>
                        <p>Let no man wonder that in theſe things (requiring Perſpectiue Arte) that there is no Pauement or other ſhortening ſéene, but I make it onely out of the ground to ſhew the meaſure of the height thereof, that you might not miſſe it by ſhortening: But in the Booke of Perſpectiue Arte theſe things are ſhewed in their right ſhortening manner (and that in diuers wayes) that is to ſay, in Superficies, and many bodies, and diuers ſorts of houſes, ſeruing thereunto: I will not now ſet downe the meaſure of Cornices downewards, for hereafter I will ſhew the Figures piece by piece, and thereof ſet downe a ſeuerall meaſure.</p>
                        <p>The Chappell in the middle, although here it ſhoweth well with the other worke, yet many men are of opinion that it is not ancient, becauſe the Arch thereof wanteth the fiue pillars, which is a thing neuer vſed by good Antiquities; but it is thought that it was made greater in the Chriſtians time, as the Chriſtians Temples alwayes haue one principall Altar which is greater then the reſt.</p>

Thus the ſkilfull workeman hath placed the Architrabe ſo much right aboue the the foure Pillars, becauſe ſuch things ſhow well.

The Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naels are foure and twenty in number, euery Canall being nine minutes and a halfe bread, the Thorus with the two Quadrats or liſts are both together foure minutes and a halfe, for the Thorus is thrée minutes, and then there reſteth a minute and a halfe, which deuided into two parts, euery Quadrate on eyther ſide is three quarters of a minute.

And although it be not ſet in Perſpectiue manner, whereby a man might ſée whether it were a rounde or foure ſquare Chappell, that is omittted becauſe of the meaſure thereof; notwithſtanding this is made for a foure ſquare, which you may ſée by the forme of the blind windowes which are within the Chappell, for the other ſhould runne more about. The thickeneſſe of theſe Columnes is fiue Palmes thrée minutes leſſe, the height of the Baſes is two Palmes and one and twenty minutes, the height of the Columnes without the Capitals is fourtie Palmes, the height of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitals is fiue Palmes and thirtie minutes; and ſo the whole Columne with the Baſes and Capitals: is fourtie and eight Palmes high. The height of the Architraue, Fréeſe and Cornice, are altogether thirteene Palmes and a halfe, and this height in all is deuided into ten parts, whereof thrée parts are for the Architraue; the other thrée are for the Sophero or the Fréeſe, and the other foure parts are for the Cornice: Touching the reſt of the other members, I ſet downe no meaſures, becauſe this is proportionably declared touching the principalleſt of them that ſtand on the ſide théereof marked with <hi>P.</hi> And in trueth, a man in this Cornice may perceiue the iudicious ſkill of the workeman, who therein touching the mutiles, would not cut any deatiles therein, thereby not to fall into that common errour, wherein ſo many ancient workemen haue fallen, and at this day more moderne workemen.

I will not ſet downe all the meaſures of this Tempel (becauſe that it is well proportioned) and a man may by part of the meaſure find out the reſt.

Touching the ground of this Theater, men could not well conceaue it: but not long ſince, the great Patrician of <hi>Rome,</hi> going to make a houſe, the ſcituation whereof was to be ſet vpon part of the Theater (this houſe was made by one <hi>Balthaſar</hi> of Sienna, an excellent workman) and as he cauſed the foundation to be digged, there were found many reliques of diuers Cornices of this Theater, and a great part of the ſame Theater was diſcouered, whereby <hi>Balthaſar</hi> concerted the whole forme thereof, and meaſured it with great circumſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, placing it in the forme following: my ſelfe being at that time in <hi>Rome,</hi> ſaw many of the Cornices, and found friendſhip to meaſure them, and in truth, there I found as excellent formes as euer I ſaw in any old Ruins, and moſt in the Capitals of Dorica, and alſo in the impoſts of the Arches, which, me thinks, agrée well with the doctrine of <hi>Vitru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uius.</hi> Likewiſe the Freeſe, Trigliphen, and Methopen, agrée well inough: but the Dorica Cornice, although it be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry full of members, and well wrought, yet I found it to differ much from <hi>Vitruuius</hi> inſtructions: for being licencious inough of members, was of ſuch a height, that the two third parts of ſuch height ſhould haue béene inough to the Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traue and the Fréeſe. But I am of opinion therefore, (by the licence of theſe, or other Antiquities) that a workeman in theſe dayes ſhould not erre, (which error, I meane, is to doe contrary to <hi>Vitruuius</hi> precepts) nor to bee peremptory that hee will make a Cornice, or other thing iuſt of the ſame proportion as hee hath ſéene and meaſured, and then ſet it in worke; becauſe it is not ſufficient for him to ſay, I may doe it: for ancient workemen haue done it, without conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whether it be proportioned according to the reſt of the building.

But you may yet ſée in the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticus going from the Theatre, there were foure ſquare Pillars, alſo the Stayres thereof were very ſimple and playne: and becauſe it is ſo much decayed, you can hardly diſcerne how they ſtood. The Scene of this Theatre is much different from others, as you may ſée in the ground thereof: neither is there ſo much ſtanding aboue ground, that a man may perceaue how the Scene and the Pulpit thereof ſtood. This ground was meaſured by the ancient foote, and firſt, ſpeaking of the Orcheſtra <hi>A.</hi> which is halfe a Circle, the Diameter thereof is <hi>141.</hi> foot and a halfe long. The body of the Theatre, that is, from the Orcheſtra, to the outtermoſt of the Corner Pillars of the Porticus, is <hi>35.</hi> foot: the Pillars of the corner on eyther ſide, is <hi>5.</hi> foote broad: the entry of the Porticus on the ſide of the Scene, is <hi>8.</hi> foote: the vault vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Stayres, is <hi>22.</hi> foote: the thickeneſſe of the Wall about the Orcheſtra, is <hi>3.</hi> foote and a halfe: the Hoſpitalia, marked <hi>X.</hi> is in length <hi>40.</hi> foot and a halfe; and in bredth <hi>30.</hi> foote: the wideneſſe of the Porticus about the Theatre, is <hi>11.</hi> foote: the Pillars are thicke and broad, <hi>3.</hi> foote and <hi>3.</hi> quarters: the wideneſſe of the Arch, is <hi>9.</hi> foote: the iuſt bredth of the Orcheſtra marked <hi>B.</hi> is <hi>20.</hi> foote: the place of the Pulpit <hi>C.</hi> is in length <hi>40.</hi> foote and a halfe; but the bredth is <hi>12.</hi> foote: the going through, is <hi>9.</hi> foote. The place marked <hi>D.</hi> ſhould be the Porticus behind the Scene: yet there is no ſhew of any Columnes; but it ſheweth that there was a wall ſtanding by the water ſide. The bredth of this place, is <hi>19.</hi> foot and a halfe.

The bredth of the Building marked <hi>E.</hi> is twenty foot: the hollow places in the ſides, are <hi>17.</hi> foote: the length of all together, is <hi>60.</hi> foote, and is diſtant from the Theatre one hundred and one and fortie foot: and from the other Building, ſeuentie foote and a halfe.</p>

Neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe, for that the firſt Order is ſo faſt and ſtrong, by meanes of the ſhutting ſtone aboue in the Arch; as alſo with the croſſe ſtone vpon it, with the faſt Facie vpon that, and by reaſon of the good ſhoulders of the Arch, which altogether ſhew to be ſuch a ſtrength (as in effect it is) that the Pilaſters that reſt vpon it, ſéeme not to oppreſſe the worke, as they would, if it were a ſimple Arch, with an Architraue, Fréeſe and Cornice: for which cauſe I blame not this inuention therein. The wideneſſe of this Arch is <hi>4.</hi> Elles: the height is nine Elles: the bredth of the Pilaſters, is two Elles and an halfe: the thickneſſe of the Columnes, is an Ell and a ſixt part in Diameter: the height of the Columnes is eleuen Elles and an eyght part with Baſes and Capitals, and are made after the Corinthia manner. The height of the Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traue, Fréeſe and Cornice, is two Elles and thrée quarters. Although I can giue no particular meaſures of this Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice, Fréeſe and Architraue, becauſe ſuch things are not to be ſéene, yet there is onely ſo much wall, that thereby a man may conceaue the Freeſes, Cornices and Architraue.</p>

                        <p>AMong other faire Antiquities in <hi>Rome,</hi> there are two Columnes of Marble, all cut full of Hiſtories, very good im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſt worke. The one is called <hi>Antonianas</hi> Columne, the other <hi>Traians</hi> Columne: and for that <hi>Traians</hi> Columne is the wholeſt, I will ſpeake ſomewhat thereof. This Columne, as men ſay, the Emperour <hi>Traian</hi> cauſed to be made, which is all of Marble, and made of many pieces; but ſo cloſely iorned together, that they ſéeme to bee all one piece: and to giue the particular meaſure thereof, I will begin at the foots of the Baſement thereof: And firſt, the degrée or ſtep in the firſt reſt, is thrée Palmes high, the Plinthus of the Baſe, is a Palme and eyght minutes high; the carued or grauen Baſe is as much: the flat of the Baſement is <hi>12.</hi> Palmes and ſixe minutes high: the grauen Cornice is a Palme and an halfe high. The place where the Feſton hangeth in, is two Palmes and ten minutes high: the whole Baſe of the Columnes, is ſixe Palmes and <hi>28.</hi> minutes, and is deuided in this manner: the Plinthus where the Eagle ſtandeth vpon one corner (but you muſt imagine that there is one at euery corner) is thrée Palmes and ten mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes high: the Thorus aboue it, is thrée Palmes and eyght minutes high: the Cincte is ten minutes high. The height of the Columne, that is, the body, is <hi>18.</hi> Palmes and <hi>9.</hi> minutes: the Aſtragall with the Quadrants or liſts vnder the Echine, is <hi>10.</hi> minutes. The height of the Echine, is <hi>2.</hi> Palmes and <hi>2.</hi> minutes: the height of the Abacus, is <hi>2.</hi> Palmes &amp; <hi>11.</hi> minutes: about vpon this Columne, there is a Pedeſtal of a round forme, through the which men crept fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the winding Stayres, and may goe eaſily round about, becauſe the plaine ground thereof, is <hi>2.</hi> Palmes and a halfe broad: the height of this Pedeſtall is <hi>11.</hi> Palmes; but the Baſe is two Palmes, and the Cornice aboue, is a Palme high. The Crowne aboue the Pedeſtall, is thrée Palmes and a halfe high: the thickeneſſe of this Pedeſtall, is <hi>12.</hi> Palmes and ten minutes: the thickeneſſe of the Columne aboue, is <hi>14.</hi> Palmes, and the thickneſſe below, is <hi>16.</hi> Palmes: the round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe marked <hi>A.</hi> in flat forme, ſheweth the thickneſſe aboue: and the Circle marked <hi>B.</hi> is the thickneſſe below. The vndeneſſe of the winding Stayres, is <hi>3.</hi> Palmes, and the Spill foure Palmes. The bredth of the Baſement, is <hi>24.</hi> Palmes and <hi>6.</hi> minutes; in the which ſpace are cut two Compartements, wherein is contained an Epitaph, vnder which many Trophees are cut: and in the Epitaph are theſe letters hereunder written.</p>

In which Figure, firſt you ſée all the degrées whereon the Spectators ſate: there alſo you may perceiue how many wayes the goings vp were, which (in truth) were very eaſte to go vp &amp; downe, ſo that in ſhort time the Amphitheater was filled with a great number of men, without hindrance one of another. You may alſo ſée in the outward part, how the thicknes of the Pilaſters, and the walles vpwards leſſened, which on the inſide are drawne in, and being ſo drawne in, giueth the building great ſtrength: and to ſhew it to be true, you may ſée there, at this day, ſome part of the Facies without, yet whole, from the top to the bottome, and yet the inward parts are decayed, and that hath the drawing inward of the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trée dens, which made the worke ſlighter, taking, as it were, a forme of a Piramides.

And withall, (as I ſayd) the innermoſt part being ſo ruinous, that men ſée no part of the innermoſt worke, which is cut off by the line that hath Shafts or Arrowheads at the ends: and for that you ſée no parts thereof at all, whether that the vppermoſt parts of the higheſt ſteps, vpwards to the top, were all couered with double Galleries, or that the Porticus was alone, and the other left open: therefore I haue made it in two maner of wayes: the one is (as you ſee in the ſame Profill) ioyned with all the worke: and the other maner is, which ſtandeth without the degrées or ſteps, which order alſo agréeth with the other, if you ſet it ſo, that the two Liſts in the Pedeſtals méete each with the other: but for that you ſée ſome remaynders of the croſſed Roofes, which yet hang within on the walles, as the fourth ground ſheweth, the which, I iudge, was onely a Porticus, and that the other part was vncouered to receiue the people, and being ſo, muſt receiue them better then if the Galleries had béene double: Now to turne to the beginning of the degrées or ſteps, that I leaue nothing vntouched, as néere as I can, I ſay, by meanes of the ruines, and filling vp with matter fallen, the playne, or the place in the middle is ſo filled vp, that a man cannot marke how high the firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grées of the playne were eleuated: but by the inſtructions of thoſe that haue ſéene the end, the firſt degrée was ſo high, that the wild and vntamed Beaſts could not hurt the beholders: and there was alſo a Borſtwering, and other ſtréetes, of a reaſonable bredth to go round about, as it is ſhewed where it is marked with <hi>C.</hi> The two open places, the leaſt and the greateſt Arch, were to bring in light.

The ſecond Order, is after the manner of Ionica: and although the Columnes be not fluited, yet in effect they may be called Ionica. The third Story, is after the manner of Corinthia, but firme worke without cutting, vnleſſe it be the Capitals, the which with their height are not exquiſitely made. The fourth Story, is Compoſita; other call it Latina, becauſe it was inuented by the Romanes: ſome others call it Italica. But it may well be called Compoſita, were it but for the mutiles which ſtand in the Fréeſe, for that no other Story haue their mutiles in the Fréeſe, but that. Many men aſke why the Romanes made this Building of foure Orders, and made it not all of one forme or order as many others are, as that of <hi>Verona,</hi> which is all of ruſticall worke, and that of <hi>Pola</hi> alſo. A man may anſwere thereunto, that the old Romanes, as rulers ouer al, &amp; eſpecially of thoſe people, from whence the thrée former Orders had their beginning, would ſet thoſe <hi>3.</hi> generations one aboue another: &amp; aboue all thoſe orders, the Compoſita, as found by themſelues; thereby ſignifying, that they as tryumphers ouer thoſe people, would alſo tryumph with their workes, placing and mingling them at their pleaſures. But omitting theſe reaſons, we will procéed to the meaſures of the outtermoſt parts and Orthographie. This Building was eleuated from the earth two degrées: the ſecond degrée was fiue Palmes broad, and the firſt two Palms; the height was little leſſe then a Palme: the Baſe of the Columne was not two Palmes, no more is the Dorica: the Columne is foure Palmes thicke and two minutes: the height is <hi>38.</hi> Palms and <hi>5.</hi> minutes, with Baſe and Capitall: the height of the Capitall is about two Palmes: the Pilaſters on eyther ſide of the Columnes, are thrée Palmes and thrée minutes: the wideneſſe of the Arch is twenty Palmes, and the height is <hi>33.</hi> Palmes: from vnder the Arch, to the Architraue, is fiue Palmes and ſixe minutes: the height of the Architraue is two Palmes and eyght minutes: the height of the Fréeſe is thrée Palmes and two minutes: the Cornice as much. The Pedeſtall of the ſecond Order, is eyght Palmes and ten minutes high: the height of the Columnes, with Baſes and Capitals, is fiue and thirty Palmes, the thickneſſe is foure Palmes: the Pilaſters and Arches are like thoſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath: but the height of the Arch is thirty Palmes: from vnder the Arch, to vnder the Architraue, is fiue Palmes and ſixe minutes: the height of the Architraue is thrée Palmes: the height of the Fréeſe, is two Palmes and nine minutes: the height of the Cornice, is thrée Palmes and nine minutes. The Pedeſtall of the fourth Order, called, Compoſita, (héere our Author hath forgotten the third Order, but howſoeuer, it differeth not much from the Ionica) the Pedeſtall of the Compoſita, is twelue Palmes high: the vnder-Baſe thereof, is foure Palmes: the height of the Pillars, with Baſes and Capitals, is thirty eyght Palmes and ſixe minutes: the height of the Architraue, Fréeſe, and Cornice, is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ten Palmes, deuided in thrée, one part for the Cornice, the ſecond for the Fréeſe, wherein the Mutiles ſtand, and the third for the Architraue. But for what cauſe, or reaſon, the workeman ſet the Mutiles in the Fréeſe, (things, which, peraduenture, before that time were neuer made) I haue deliuered my opinion thereof in my fourth Booke, in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Order of Compoſita. The Pillars of the fourth Order are flat, and riſe but a little: all thereſt are round Columnes, (that is to ſay) thrée fourth parts, riſing out of the Pilaſters: the Mutiles aboue the windowes vpheld ſome beames, the which are boared through with holes for men to draw cords to couer the hole Amphitheater, as well a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Sunne as the rayne: for what cauſe the Columnes are all of one thickneſſe, and leſſen not one more then the other (as it ſéemeth they ſhould; and as <hi>Vitruuius</hi> would) as the ſecond Order are leſſened a fourth part, I haue alſo declared my opinion in the fourth Booke, and the ninth Chapter. In the treatiſe of making Columnes, longer or ſhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and that the particular members may alſo be noted, I haue marked them alſo by the Orthographie of the Coliſceo, which are proportioned according to the principall, together with their Caracters whereunto they are likened.</p>

And thirdly, there followeth the Orthographie of a péece of the ſayd Amphitheater without, which is all wrought after the ruſticall manner, with ſtones of Verona, being very hard: but the Cornices are ſomewhat better made: which Cornices haue diuers and ſeuerall Formes of the Romanes, and are very like vnto the Cornices of the Amphitheater of Pola. Touching the playneneſſe of this Amphitheater, which by the Common people is called, <hi>La arena,</hi> (taken from <hi>arena</hi>) which is ſand, which was therein ſtrowed for certayne Playes or ſports, which were there preſented or Acted: and therefore I could not ſée the ground thereof: but as it was told me by ſome old men of Verona, when the Playes were there made vpon the ſand, then preſently there came water, in the ſight of all the beholders, which paſt through ſome Conduits, and in ſhort ſpace filled all the place full, ſo that there they might make battailes, and thruſt one at another with Scutes and Boates, in the water, and the place dryed vp agayne, as at the firſt. This, and many other things, men may beléeue, if we conſider the great magnificence of the Romanes, in the Antiquities of Verona. There are yet vpon the great Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer of Adixe two fayre ancient Bridges, betwéene the which two Bridges, there was a moſt fayre and notable Spectaele, whereon there might ſtand a great number of people, to behold the Playes and ſports there made in Boates, vpon the water: which Spectacle was made along by the water ſide, againſt a hill: and higher vpwards, aboue this Spectacle, there was a Theater, the Scene whereof, and the Spectacle ioyned together: (and for that, as I ſayd before, the Theater was made very artificially in the hill, ſo is it aboue the Theater in the height of the hill) there was a great building, which ſurpaſſed all the other: but the ruines of theſe buildings are ſo many, and ſo caſt downe in proceſſe of time, that it would be great charges and loſſe of tune to find them out: but for that in many places of the hill I haue ſéne ſome parts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, therefore it makes me wonder thereat.

The height of the Pedeſtall vnder the Pillar, is <hi>2.</hi> foot and an halfe: the height of the Pillar, of flat Columne with the Capitall, is about <hi>16.</hi> foot: the height of the Arch, is <hi>17.</hi> foot and an halfe: the Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traue is a foot and <hi>9.</hi> ounces high: the height of the Freeſe, is <hi>9.</hi> ounces: the height the Cornice, is one foot &amp; <hi>10.</hi> ounces: the height of the borſt-wering or place breſt-high (if there bee any other) aboue the Cornice, is ae high as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Cornice: the height of the Pillar is <hi>21.</hi> foot &amp; <hi>9.</hi> ounces, with the Capitall: the height of the Arch, is <hi>18.</hi> foot and one ounce: the thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Arch, is <hi>1.</hi> foot and <hi>9.</hi> ounces: the Architraue, Freeſe and Cornice, are of the ſame height that the vndermoſt is: the Baſement marked <hi>X.</hi> is <hi>4.</hi> foot and <hi>4</hi> ounces. From the Baſement to vnder the Cornice, is <hi>19</hi> foot: the height of the Cornice is one foot and an halfe. And this is touching the Orthographie of the Amphitheater, the which Orthographie is on the next ſide, marked <hi>P.</hi> and for that (as in the Treaty of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Ichnographia I haue ſayd) the Amphitheater hath ſome Pilaſters on foure ſides, which were made for ſtrengthening &amp; counterforting of the walls: the which wall ſtood within, without any thing elſe; and therefore I meane to ſhew how it ſtood: the Figure marked <hi>Q.</hi> ſheweth the ſides of this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfort: &amp; that part marked <hi>H.</hi> repreſenteth a Pilaſter: that part marked <hi>I.</hi> ſheweth the Profill of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wall of the Amphithe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ater: betwéene the Pilaſter <hi>H.</hi> and the wall or Pilaſter marked <hi>I.</hi> is a going through of three foot and an halfe wide: ſo that two men may goe through together. Theſe counterforts haue their ground in euery order or ſtory, whereon the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple might ſtand; but there are no ſtayres nor ſignes of ſtayres, but were made of wood, as may be ſeene by ſome holes before the windowes. And that the Cornices of this preſent Building may be the better vnderſtood, therefore I haue ſet them there beſides in greater forme, that a man may know their members, by their Caracters or Letters which they are marked withal. The manner of this Cornicement is much different fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Romiſh, as men may ſée: and I, for my part, would not make ſuch Cornices in my worke; but with the Theater of this Towne, I would ſerue my turne, becauſe they are of a better manner of worke. I am of opinion, that this was an other workeman, different from the other, and it may be that this workeman was a high Almaine, becauſe the Cornices are made much after the Dutch manner.</p>

                        <p>IT would be troubleſome both to the writer and to the Reader, if I ſhould ſet downe all the parts of theſe Ornaments, from member to member, as they are diligently meaſured; &amp; that not onely with foote, but alſo with parts of minutes: but I haue taken the paynes onely to ſet the ſame downe out of the great into the ſmall forme, in ſuch ſort, that he that is diſcréete, may with his Compaſſe find the proportion thereof. It is true, that the Ornaments of the moſt part of the Tryumphant Arches in Rome are much contrary to <hi>Vitruuius</hi> writing; and this, I thinke, is the cauſe, that the ſayd Arches are, for the moſt part, made by the Roofes of other buildings, (that is, of as many ſorts of péeces as they could get:) and it may be, that the workemen in thoſe dayes were ſelfe willed, and ſtood not much vpon obſeruation, becauſe they were things ſeruing for Tryumphs, and it may bee (as it hapneth oftentimes) made in haſte. That part here on the ſide ſet downe, marked <hi>A.</hi> is the Baſe of the Epitaph. <hi>B.</hi> is the higheſt Cornice, Fréeſe, and Architraue: which Cornice, in my opin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>on, is very licencious for diuers reaſons: The firſt, it is proportioned too high: from the nether Architraue, and aboue it, there are too many members, and eſpecially Mutiles and Dentiles, which ſtanding alike in one Cornice, are diſlilted by <hi>Vitruuius,</hi> notwithſtanding it is very well wrought, and ſpecially the Scima a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue: but had I ſuch a Cornice to make (obſeruing the right order) I would make the Scima leſſe, and the Cornice more: I would leaue the Mutiles as they be, and I would not cut the Denticules, but the Cimated. The Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traue hereof pleaſeth mee well inough. The two members marked <hi>C.</hi> ſhew the Facie and the Profill of the Menſola, which is the cloſing ſtone of the Arch. The members marked with <hi>E.</hi> are, in truth, rich for worke, but yet ſo rich, that the one darkeneth the other: but if the parts were ſo deuided, that the one were grauen, and the other playne, I would commend it more. And herein the workeman that made the Pantheon, was very iudicious, for that you ſée no ſuch confuſion in his Ornaments. The worke vnder this Arch is very well made and deuided; it is alſo a fayre Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment, and rich of worke. But it may be, that ſuch as are too much conceited to commend Antiquities of Rome, will (peraduenture) thinke that I am too bold to cenſure vpon that which hath béene made by ſuch ſkilfull ancient Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes; but in this reſpect. I would haue them take my ſpéeches in good part, for that all my intent is, to ſhew it them that know it not, and ſuch as will ſubiect themſelues to heare my opinion: for it is not ſufficient to make ancient things as they ſtand, but it is another thing with <hi>Vitruuius</hi> aduice to chuſe out the beſt and fayreſt, and to reiect the worſe. It is true, that the chiefeſt part of an Architector is, that hee miſtaketh not himſelfe in giuing his cenſure, as many doe, who being obſtinate in their opinions, make all things as they haue ſéene them, and hereby couer their vnſkilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, without giuing any other reaſons of things: and there are ſome that ſay, <hi>Vitruuius</hi> was but a man, and that they alſo are men ſufficient, to make and inuent new things, without regarding, that <hi>Vitruuius</hi> confeſſeth to haue learned it from ſo many ſkilfull men, partly in his owne time, as alſo by meanes of the writing of other work men.</p>

                        <p>IN the kingdome of <hi>Naples, viz.</hi> betwéene <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Naples</hi> there are many Antiquities; for that the Romanes had great pleaſure in thoſe places: among the which, this Tryumphant Arch is ſéene, being yet all whole and fayre to ſight: and therefore I thought it good to ſet it among the number of the reſt of the Arches (which were made by the Romanes.) This Arch is at <hi>Beneuente,</hi> on this ſide of <hi>Naples,</hi> and was meaſured with a moderne Ell, whereof the third part is hereunder ſet downe. The Figure here below, is the Ichnographie of the ſame Arch; and to ſhew by whom this Arch was made, is néedleſſe, becauſe it may be vnderſtood by the writing that ſtandeth thereon. The wideneſſe of the Arch, is ryght Elles: the thickneſſe of the Columnes is an Ell: the Pilaſter vnder the Arch, is alſo as broad: the inter-columne holds thrée Elles: the height of the Arch, is almoſt as much againe as the bredth: the height of the Baſe of the Pedeſtall, with the vnder-Baſe, is one Ell, ten ounces and ſixe minutes: the flat of the Pedeſtall, is two Elles, ten ounces and ſixe minutes: the height of his Cornice, is nine ounces: the height of the Baſes of the Columnes, is ſeuen ounces: the height of the Columnes, without Baſes or Capitals, is nine Elles and foure ounces. The thickneſſe of the Columnes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath, is an Ell in Diameter, and aboue is leſſened a ſixt part: the height of the Capitall, is an Ell, fiue ounces and an halfe: the height of the Architraue, is <hi>15.</hi> ounces: the Fréeſe is ſeuentéene ounces high: the height of the Cornice, is oue Ell, thrée ounces and an halfe: the Plinthus, which ſtandeth as counter-Baſe aboue the Cornice, is <hi>19.</hi> ounces and a quarter high: the Baſe ſtanding vpon it, is <hi>11.</hi> ounces high: the height of the Epitaph, is foure Elles and two ounces: the height of the outtermoſt Cornice, is one Ell and thrée minutes: the height of the impoſt of the Arch, is halfe an Ell.</p>

This Figure, marked <hi>D.</hi> is the Impoſt of the Arch, and is well knowne for ſuch a member; the ſame Cornice changeth it ſelfe in a Facie, which goeth round, as you ſée, and is halfe an Ell high: and although this Impoſt of the Arch ſheweth no Sculpture, yet is it grauen where it ſtandeth; but I forgot to draw it is.</p>

                        <p>BY the Amphitheater of Rome, which by the people is called Coliſceo, there ſtandeth a very faire Tryumphant Arch, which is wonderfull rich of Ornaments, Images, and diuers Hiſtories, it was dedicated to Conſtantine, and is vſually called, <hi>Larco de Trafill.</hi> This fayre Arch, although it is now buried a great part within the earth, by meanes of the ruines, and riſing of the earth, is neuertheleſſe of great height, and the Gates and paſſages through it, are yet higher then two foure ſquares. This Arch (as is before ſayd) is paſſing fayre to the eye, and wonderfull rich of Ornaments &amp; grauing. It is very true, that the Cornices are not of the beſt maner, although they be excéeding richly gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, whereof I will ſpeake hereafter.

The height of the flat, is <hi>7.</hi> Palms and <hi>5.</hi> minutes: the height of the Cornices of the Pedeſtals, is <hi>42.</hi> minutes: the height of the counter-Baſe, vnder the Baſe, or the Plinthus of the Columne, is fiftie and two minutes: the height of the Baſe is <hi>60.</hi> minutes: the height of the body of the Columnes, without Baſe or Capitall, is <hi>26.</hi> Palmes and <hi>25.</hi> minutes: the height of the Capitall, is <hi>2.</hi> Palmes and <hi>35.</hi> minutes, and is Compoſits.

                           <hi>I</hi> Haue ſpoken of the proportion of the meaſures of the Tryumphant Arch of the Emperour <hi>Conſtantine:</hi> now I will ſpeake of the ſeuerall parts and Cornicements, and ſet their meaſures downe. And firſt, the Baſe marked <hi>F.</hi> is of the Pedeſtall of the ſaid Arch: the height whereof, is a Palme and <hi>30.</hi> minutes. The height of the Plinthus vnder the Baſe is <hi>28.</hi> minutes: the reſt of the parts are meaſurably deuided, and proportioned accordingly. The height of the Cornices of the Pedeſtall, which ſtand marked vnder the Baſe <hi>E.</hi> is <hi>42.</hi> minutes, and is alſo proportioned according to the principall. The counter-Baſe, vnder the Baſe of the Columnes (which I thinke were placed there accidentally) to heighten the Columnes, is <hi>32.</hi> minutes high: the whole height of this Baſe of the Columnes, is <hi>53.</hi> minutes: touching the height of the Columnes, I ſpake before, and alſo of the Capitals; of which Capitals, the forme ſtandeth not here, for that the like doth ſtand in my fourth Booke, of the Order of Compoſita: the height of the Architraues, Fréeſes and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nices, is alſo ſpoken of before: and this Cornice is very ſéemely, for that there is no licenciouſneſſe in it, which is in ſome other Baſes of this Arch; as it is in the impoſt of the middlemoſt Arch, marked <hi>C.</hi> the which impoſt is greater and of more members and parts, then the great and principall Cornice, and is altogether confuſed in members, and that which is moſt intolerable, the Dentiles and Mutiles are one aboue the other: and although the Dentiles were not there, yet there néeded not ſuch a Cornice to beare vp an Arch. Herein the workeman of the Theater of <hi>Marcellus</hi> was more cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpect then this: for the impoſts of the Arches of the ſaid Theater, are the fayreſt and beſt of ſhew for impoſts that euer I ſaw, and ſuch, as from the which a man may learne to make the like. The impoſt of the leſſer Arches marked <hi>D.</hi> is one Palme and <hi>23.</hi> minutes and an halfe high: the which impoſt would ſtand much better, if the two flats betwéene the Aſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall aboue, and the Echine vnder, were turned into playnneſſe only; which then would ſerue for an Abacus, or alſo for a crowne, hauing the due Proiecture. The Baſe vnder the ſecond ſtory marked <hi>A.</hi> is <hi>16.</hi> minutes high: the height of the vppermoſt Cornice, is <hi>43.</hi> minutes, which height ſhould bee too little in ſo great a diſtance, if it were not that the great Proiecture or Gallery, or ouerhanging holpe it not; becauſe they are ſeeing vpwards, from vnderneath, which ſheweth it to be much greater then it is: therefore I much commend this Cornice in this reſpect. And truely, all the Cornices, whereof the crowne hath more proiecture then height, anſwere alwayes better, and may be made thinner of ſtone, ſo that the members of the building endure leſſe wayght: neuertheleſſe, you muſt not make them of too many licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious proiectures: but you ſhall read hereof in <hi>Vitruuius,</hi> where he entreateth of the Order of crownes, after the maner of Ionica and Dorica: for he doeth there teach you clearely inough.</p>

There were alſo betwéene the Columnes, aboue the Cornices, certaine Images of Copper, as the letters in thoſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces written, doe ſhew: there are alſo tokens of holes, which ſhewes that there were Kings of Copper, or other ſuch like things hanging in them, which might bee taken from the Eothes, Vandals, or other enemies.

                        <p>IN my opinion, I haue ſayd enough of the meaſure of the Arch of <hi>Ancona,</hi> yet that the parts of the Cornices may be the better vnderſtood, I will ſhew them here greater: and firſt, I will ſet downe the loweſt parts, as they ſtand aboue the ground of the worke. The height of the Pedeſtall, marked <hi>G.</hi> is ſayd to be of <hi>5.</hi> foot, with all the Cornices there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: but the height of the Plinthus of the Baſe, is <hi>18.</hi> minutes: the Baſe aboue the Plinthus, is <hi>19.</hi> minutes, and a third part high: the Cornice of the Pedeſtall, is <hi>20.</hi> minutes, and a third part high; ſo much doeth the ſtone alſo hold, ſtanding thereby, marked <hi>F.</hi> which, by my aduice, is placed there, to heighten the Columnes, and ſheweth not badly, but more, becauſe it is ſet forth with a liſt round about it; whereby the Baſe differeth from the Plinthus: and ſo, in my opinion, ſtandeth well. The Baſe, which is Corinthia, together with the Cincte of the Columne, is <hi>43.</hi> minutes high: and the Proiecture, is <hi>16.</hi> minutes and an halfe in bredth: the thickneſſe of the Pedeſtall, is <hi>3.</hi> foote, <hi>15.</hi> minutes and an halfe: the thickneſſe of the Columne, is <hi>2.</hi> foote, <hi>11.</hi> minutes: and there ſtand <hi>13.</hi> hollowings, or chanels, without the Pilaſter: the wideneſſe of one chanell, is <hi>7.</hi> minutes and a halfe: and the Liſt which parteth them, is <hi>2.</hi> minutes and a halfe. The height of the Capitals are the thickneſſe of the Columnes below, without the Abacus: which Capitall hath a very fayre forme, whereby we may be perſwaded and beleeue, that <hi>Vitruuius</hi> doctrine is falſe, and that <hi>Vitruui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> vnderſtood the height of the Capitall without Abacus: (and for this cauſe) for that the moſt part of the Capitals that I haue ſéene and meaſured, are moſt of ſuch height, and higher, and ſpecially the Capitals that ſtand in the Rotund: whereof, in the beginning of this Booke you may ſée one. The height of the Architraue aboue the Columne, is one foote and twelue minutes. The height of the Fréeſe, is one foote and eyghtéene minutes. The height of the Cornice, is one foote and two and twenty minutes. Theſe thrée are marked together with an <hi>A.</hi> The Plinthus aboue the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice is one foote, ſixe minutes and an halfe high: The Baſe vpon it, is thirtie minutes: the ſpace wherein the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are written, is ſire foote and two and twenty minutes, and is marked with <g ref="char:cross">✚</g>. The Impoſt of the Arch is marked <hi>D.</hi> the height whereof is <hi>1.</hi> foote and fiftéene minutes: but the vppermoſt Cornice, as I haue ſayd, was not meaſured. The height of the Menſole in place of the cloſing ſtone, marked <hi>B.</hi> aboue the Arch, is thrée foot and <hi>30.</hi> minutes: and hath a foote and <hi>14.</hi> minutes without the wall, in the vppermoſt part; and in the parts below, it comes out a foot. The foure tables with the Cornices vpon them, which ſtand betwéene the Columnes, are thought to be placed there, for hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vp of halfe Images: the forme whereof, ſtandeth here marked <hi>E.</hi> and is there alſo by the Profill on the ſide, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by a man may ſée how they are wrought: for they are full of worke, euen to the Center. The height of the Cornices, ſtanding aboue them, is <hi>32.</hi> minutes: and although I haue not ſhewed all the Proiectures &amp; heights from part to part, yet I haue with great diligence reduced them from the great, into a ſmall forme, and were (as I ſayd before of the reſt) meaſured with the old Romane foot.</p>

                        <p>THe Towne of <hi>Pola</hi> in <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> is adorned with many Antiquities: beſides the Theater &amp; Amphitheater, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I ſpake before, there are other Buildings, whereof now I will ſpeake. There is an Arch Tryumphant, of Corinthia worke, rich of ornaments, for Figures, works, and ſtrange deuices; ſo that from the Pedeſtal vpwards, there is no worke nor ſpace leſt vngrauen, not onely before, but alſo on the ſides, and within, and vnder in the Arch, wherein are many and diuers works, ſo that it would require long time to declare them particularly: therefore I will ſhew ſuch parts thereof as are neceſſary for a workeman, for inuention and Arte. The ground of the Arch following ſtandeth hereunder, meaſured with a Moderne or common foote, whereof the halfe is here ſet downe. The Arch is <hi>12.</hi> foot and a halfe wide: the height is about <hi>21.</hi> foot. The Pilaſters in the ſides inward are <hi>4.</hi> foot thicke. The thicknes of a Columne is one foote, <hi>9.</hi> ounces and a halfe. The Intercolumne is <hi>2.</hi> foot, <hi>3.</hi> ounces and a halfe. The Pilaſter of the Arch is one foot, <hi>2.</hi> ounces broad. The height of the Plinthus vnder the Baſe of the Pedeſtall, is one foote. The Baſe is <hi>4.</hi> ounces high. The flat of the Pedeſtall is <hi>3.</hi> foot: the Cornice <hi>4.</hi> ounces. The Plinthus marked <hi>D.</hi> vnder the Columnes is <hi>4.</hi> ounces. The height of the Baſe with the Plinthus is <hi>10.</hi> ounces and one quarter. The height of the Columne is <hi>16.</hi> foote, one ounce and <hi>3.</hi> quarters. The height of the Capitall is <hi>2.</hi> foot and one ounce. The height of the Architraue is one foote and one ounce. The height of the Fréeſe is one foote and <hi>2.</hi> ounces. The height of the Cornice is one foote and <hi>10</hi> ounces. The height of the Plinthus aboue the Cornice is one foote and <hi>2.</hi> ounces. The height of the Baſe of the Pedeſtall, and alſo of the Plinthus vpon it, is one foote and <hi>2.</hi> ounces: but the height of the Baſe alone is <hi>10.</hi> ounces. The height of the flat of the Pedeſtall is <hi>2.</hi> foote and one ounce. The Cornice is <hi>6.</hi> ounces.

                        <p>IN the ſide before, I haue ſpoken of the vniuerſall meaſure of the Arch triumphant of <hi>Pola,</hi> and haue alſo ſhewed the Figure thereof, and partly ſet downe ſome of the richeſt and faireſt ornaments of the ſame: Now I will ſet downe the particular meaſures of the parts thereof: and firſt, I will begin with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> nether parts, as that was placed firſt aboue the ground. The height of the Plinthus vnder the Baſe of the Pedeſtall, is one foot; although that vnder it there lieth another of much more height, but it is vnder the earth: the height of the Cimatie turned about aboue it, with the Aſtragalus, is <hi>4.</hi> ounces: the flat of the Pedeſtall, is <hi>3.</hi> foot high: the Cimatie aboue, it is <hi>4.</hi> ounces, &amp; ſo much alſo is the vnder-Baſe, aboue the Cimatie: the height of the Baſe of the Columnes, is <hi>10.</hi> ounces, and is very well cut and grauen: and although the forme is Dorica, yet the delicate works thereof ſhew that it is Corinthia: the Columnes are fluited or chaneled from the top to the bottom; and there are alſo many hollowings without the Pilaſter, as the Figure hereafter doeth ſhew. The height of the Capitall with the Abacus, is two foote and one ounce: the which Capitall is higher then the thickneſſe of the Columne beneath. Neuertheleſſe, it is very well, and ſheweth pleaſing to ſight; it is alſo richly wrought, as it is here ſhewed in the Figure thereof: and alwayes, as the Capitall of Corinthia is in ſuch proportion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Columne, I would thinke it better to the view of workemen; then if with the Abacus it had but the height of the Diameter of the Columne: and although <hi>Vitruuius</hi> writeth thus (as is before ſayd) yet may his text be falſified. The height of the Architraue, is one foot and one ounce: the height of the Fréeſe, is one foote and two ounces: the height of the Cornice, is a foote and ten ounces: which Cornice is very licencions, although it be rich of worke, becauſe ſuch rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of worke confoundeth it: but that which is moſt vnſéemely in it, is the Echine with the Ouale aboue the Seima, a thing, in trueth, much vnſightly: and that, which is more worthy laughter, is, that the ſaid Echine in the vpper part, is cut through, without being couered with any liſt, that it might not bee conſumed with the water. But there hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes béene licencious workemen, as there are yet in our dayes, who, to pleaſe the people, make much grauing in their workes, without reſpecting the qualities of the orders, and will alſo in Dorica worke, which ſhould bee faſt and ſtrong, vſe much grauing and cutting, as in Corinthia worke, which, by their folly, aſketh many ornaments. But wiſe and iudicious workemen will alwayes obſerue Decorum: and if they make worke after Dorica maner, they will follow good Antiquities: which, for the moſt part, agrée with <hi>Vitruuius</hi> precepts. If they make any worke after the Corinthia maner, then they couer them with Ornaments, as that kind of worke requireth. This I haue ſet downe, to aduertiſe thoſe thereof that know it not; for they that know it, néede not my aduice. Now to come to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe agayne: Aboue this Cornice there is a Baſement, which maketh out thrée Pedeſtals; the Plinthus vnder the Baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which is there ſet againſt the proiecture of the Cornices, (for otherwiſe, in looking vp, it would darken the Baſe) is a foot high; aboue it ſtandeth the Baſe, whereof the height is <hi>10.</hi> ounces: the flat of the Baſement, is <hi>2.</hi> foot &amp; <hi>1.</hi> ounce high: the Cornice aboue it, is halfe a foote high; which Cornice is very ſeemely, and the parts thereof deuide themſelues very well from each other, for that betwéene the two carued members there ſtandeth one playne aboue: the Cornice is that member or part, called <hi>Corona liſis,</hi> as I vnderſtand <hi>Vitruuius,</hi> whereof the height is <hi>5.</hi> ounces. Aboue theſe there are ſome ſtones that ſhew to no end at all, but it may be thought, that ſome things ſtoode vpon them: the height of theſe ſtones is <hi>10.</hi> ounces: the height of the Impoſt of this Arch is <hi>10.</hi> ounces; the which Impoſt is very licenciouſly made: and although thoſe <hi>3.</hi> members one aboue the other, are diuers, yet they are like each other in proiecture: and therefore in the worke they ſtand to no good effect: the other parts you ſhall know by the Caracters in the great Arch.</p>

                        <p>IN <hi>Verona,</hi> there are many tryumphant Arches; among the reſt, there is one Gate, called <hi>Caſtel Vecchio:</hi> the which, truely, is of good proportion: this Arch, as men conceaue, was wrought both before and behind, and alſo on the ſides: it had two goings in, as you may perceaue by the ground which is yet ſéene, although I ſhewed but one ſide onely. This building was meaſured by the ſame foot, wherewith the Arch of <hi>Pola</hi> aforeſayd was meaſured. The widenes of this Arch is ten foote and an halfe: the thickneſſe of the Columnes, is two foot and two ounces: the intercolumnes, are <hi>4.</hi> foot and <hi>3.</hi> ounces: the Pilaſter or Pillar of the Arch, is <hi>2.</hi> foote and <hi>2.</hi> ounces broad. The thickeneſſe of the Arch in the ſides inward, is <hi>4.</hi> foot and an halfe: the wideneſſe of the Tabernacle betwéene the Columnes, is two foot and ten ounces: and thus much for the wideneſſe and thickeneſſe: but comming to the height, the Baſe of the Pedeſtall of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnes, together with the Plinthus, is one foote and thrée ounces high: the flat of the Pedeſtall, is foure foot, thrée ounces and an halfe: the Cornice is ten ounces and an halfe: the height of the Baſe of the Columnes, is one foot: the height of the body of the Columne, without Baſe or Capitall, is <hi>17.</hi> foote and thrée ounces: the height of the Capitall, is two foot, foure ounces and an halfe. The height of the Architraue, is one foot and an halfe: the height of the Fréeſe is one foote, <hi>7.</hi> ounces and an halfe: the height of the Cornice, is one foot and ten ounces: and although that in this Figure there is the Frontiſpice, yet you ſée it not in the Arch; for from the firſt Cornice vpwards there is nothing at all: neuertheleſſe, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the wall is this yéere conſumed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet you may ſée there ſome ſignes, whereby a man may conceaue that the Fronti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpice hath béene there. The vppermoſt Cornice is not there, and therefore I ſet no meaſures, according to all Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: but I haue made one, with ſuch meaſure and formes, as my ſelfe would haue made it, hauing for a common rule, that the vppermoſt things ſtand the fourth part leſſe, then the nethermoſt: this Cornice therefore, ſhall be the fourth part leſſe then that which ſtandeth vnder it, and is thus deuided, that the whole height ſhould be ſet in foure parts and an halfe: the halfe part ſhall be for the Aſtragal with the liſt, and the fourth part ſhalbe for the Scima. The Proiecture muſt be like the height, &amp; ſo ſhall this vppermoſt Cornice be made in maner aforeſaid. Betwéene the Columnes ſtand Tabernacles, wherein there were Images, whereof the wideneſſe is two foot and ten ounces: the height is ſeuen foote, and the depth thereof in the wal, is one foote and ten ounces: the height of their Baſement, is <hi>4.</hi> foot, with the Baſe and Scima: the little Pillars on eyther ſide, are halfe a foot thicke: the Architraue is <hi>7.</hi> ounces and an halfe: the Fréeſe is <hi>6.</hi> ounces high: the height of the Cornice without the Scima is <hi>4.</hi> ounces: the height of the Timpanum of the Frontiſpice, is <hi>8.</hi> ounces. Aboue theſe Tabernacles are ſmall tablets with other Cornices: the which tablets are two foot broad, and hold one foot in height: the height of each Cornice is <hi>11.</hi> ounces: the height of the openneſſe of the Arch, although it be ſomewhat dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

The ſecond reaſon is this, that <hi>Vitruuius Polio,</hi> in his writing of Architecture, doeth vtterly condemne and reiect Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles and Dentiles, ſtanding together in one Cornice, and ſuch a Cornice is found in this Arch.

The Columne is ſtrycked, chanelled or hollowed, from the toy to the bottom. The height of the Capitall of this Columne, is one foot, <hi>4.</hi> ounces and an halfe: but the forme is not here, becauſe it is ſhewed in the beginning of the Order of Compoſita: which Capitall, in effect, is Compoſita, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Arch may be wholly accompted to bee Corinthia: and this Capitall ſtandeth in that place, maked <hi>C.</hi> Alſo, in the ſame place you ſee the Capitall of the impoſt of the Arch, which is marked with <hi>D.</hi> But the little Capitall of the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle betweene the Columnes, is here marked <hi>H.</hi> And the Cornice alſo, with the Eaſe, marked <hi>E.</hi> is that which is vnder the Tabernacle. The Figure <hi>C.</hi> is the table aboue the ſayd Tabernacles, and the Figure marked <hi>D.</hi> is the Architraue, Fréeſe and Cornice, of the Frontiſpicium of the Tabernacle. The Figure marked with <hi>B.</hi> is the worke which goeth about the Arch: the Cornice marked <hi>A.</hi> is the principall Cornice aboue the Arch; the which, in effect, is very comely, and well wrought: yet it is vicious, as I haue often ſayd; that is, the Mutiles and the Dentiles therein are by <hi>Vitruuius</hi> reiected, with many ſtrong reaſons. But in this, many men affirme, that fithence <hi>Vitruuius</hi> time, many workemen haue made Mutiles with Dentiles, in moſt places of <hi>Italy,</hi> and there round about, ſo that now there is no queſtion made thereof; but euery man hath libertie to make that in his worke which he findeth and ſéeth in Antiquities: whereunto I anſwere, that diſprouing the ſame, they haue prooued their cauſe to be good. But if they will acknowledge <hi>Vitruuius</hi> for a learned Architector, as moſt workemen affirme, then (reading <hi>Vitruuius</hi> with good iudgement) they muſt confeſſe and acknowledge, that they haue done amiſſe therein.</p>

                        <p>IN Verena, at the Gate <hi>Dei Leoni,</hi> there is a Tryumphant Arch, with two like goings through, which I neuer ſaw in any other place beſides, but many with <hi>3.</hi> Arches: which building, although it hath the figure of <hi>6.</hi> windowes, yet go they not through, neyther yet very déepe in the wall: whereby you may iudge, that ſome round Images ſtoode in them. Aboue the firſt Cornice this building is hollow, in maner of a Nich or ſeate, but not very déepe in the wall, but yet with helpe of the proiecture, or ſtriking out of the Cornice, men might ſtand there to doe ſome thing or other, while the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph laſted: but for that this concerneth the workeman very little, I will ſpeake of the meaſures. And firſt, the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the <hi>1.</hi> Arch is <hi>11.</hi> foote wide, and <hi>18.</hi> foote high: the Blocke vnder the Pedeſtall, is one foote high: the Baſe of the Pedeſtall is <hi>3.</hi> Ounces: the flat of the Pedeſtall is <hi>2.</hi> foote and one Ounce high: and the Cornice is <hi>3.</hi> Ounces: the height of the Baſes of the Columnes is <hi>8.</hi> Ounces and a halfe: the height of the Columnes, without Baſes or Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitals is <hi>12.</hi> foote and <hi>1.</hi> third part: their thicknes is <hi>1.</hi> foot, <hi>4.</hi> Ounces: the height of the Capitall is <hi>1.</hi> foote, <hi>8.</hi> Oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: the height of the Architraue is one foote, <hi>5.</hi> Ounces: the height of the Fréeſe is one foote, <hi>8.</hi> Ounces; and ſo much is the height of the Cornices: from the Cornices to the ſecond Roofe is <hi>3.</hi> foote and a halfe, whereon there are certayne Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, whereupon Images had ſtoode, made faſt to the <hi>7.</hi> Pilaſters, betwéene which, little windowes, beautified with ſmall pillars, ſtand, but not much bearing out: the widenes of a window is <hi>2.</hi> foote, <hi>2.</hi> Ounces: their height is <hi>4.</hi> foot, <hi>3</hi> Ounces: the height of the greateſt Columnes is <hi>5.</hi> foote, <hi>4.</hi> Ounces, with Baſes and Capitals which are flat, not not much rayſed vp.

This Arch is not very thicke, neyther beautified on the ſides; for that behind this Arch there is another, ſtanding ſo néere to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, that a man can hardly goe betwéene them both, as I will ſhew hereafter when I ſpeake of the other figure: the windowes ſtand not in any good order, but ſomewhat vnſéemely: for the <hi>2.</hi> windowes are not right in Perpendicular vpon the ſharpe poynt of the Frontiſpice, but ſome part aſide, which ſheweth not well: and for that I could not endure ſuch diſorder, I haue placed them orderly.

                        <p>Louing Reader, <hi>Corottus,</hi> a Paynter in Verona, hath counterfeited this Arch: the Cornice vnder the Timpanum is not there: for he placeth there certayne order of figures reſting vpon the Architraue: the which Architraue, you muſt vnderſtand, is betweene the <hi>2.</hi> Columnes ouer each Arch, and is ſomewhat flat, becauſe of the writing following.</p>

                        <p>HEre before, I ſpake of the vniuerſall meaſure of the ſayd Arch, and thereunto ſet downe the forme, according to the proportion of the ſame, but cannot giue perfectly the particular parts in ſo ſmall a forme. Of which members, for that there are diuers ornaments in them, I will in this leaſe declare them: touching the height and thickneſſe, I will ſpeake no more; for I haue done it already: but I will onely ſhew which they are. The Figure marked <hi>G.</hi> is the firſt Pedeſtall, with the Baſes, and the beginning of the Columnes, the which is hollowed: all the members are proportioned according to their greatneſſe. The Capitall marked <hi>E.</hi> hauing the Architraue vpon it, followeth vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the firſt Columne, as the hollowing ſheweth. The Figure marked <hi>D.</hi> is the Architraue, Fréeſe and Cornice toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which ſtand aboue the firſt Columne: which Cornice, by the authoritie and example, which is by me in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces alledged, the iudicious Reader may know, whether they be erroneous or good. The Capitall marked <hi>F.</hi> is that, which vpholdeth the Arch vpon the foureſquare Pillars; theſe two Capitals are called, Latine worke, and very fayre. I will not, as I haue ſaid, ſpeake of the meaſures, for that this Figure is proportioned after the principall, and with great diligence tranſported from the great into the ſmall.</p>

                        <p>AS I ſayd before, the Arch is very rich of ornaments, and among them, ſome very fayre and perfect; ſome alſo very vicious &amp; ill made: and in trueth, I finde nothing that more miſliketh me, then the Cornice marked <hi>D.</hi> in the other leaſe, for the reaſons before ſhewed: but all the reſt before ſet downe are of good proportion, as well the workes as the Cornices. And as the parts of the firſt ſtory are, ſo are theſe following of the ſecond ſtory. The Mutiles marked <hi>H.</hi> are in the beginning of the ſecond ſtory aboue the Frontiſpicie: vpon which Images (as I haue declared) there were Images faſtened againſt the flat Pilaſters. The window marked <hi>I.</hi> is the forme of one of the Windowes with the Cornice vpon it and therefore iuſt of his meaſure. That Capitall and the Baſe marked <hi>K.</hi> is of the ſame windowes, ſhewed in greateſt forme, that the members may be the better vnderſtood. That Baſe and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitall marked <hi>L.</hi> is the little Pillar betweene the Pilaſters and the window: and in trueth, in theſe two Baſes, that is, that of the greateſt of the ſmall Pillars ioyned with the leſſer, the workeman was very iudicious to accord or agrée the one with the other, that the greateſt Pillar ſhould haue his due Baſe, and the leſſer ſhould alſo haue a leſſe Baſe, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to proportion, which I commend much. The Architraue, Fréeſe and Cornice, marked <hi>C.</hi> ſheweth that of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond ſtory, aboue the ſmall Pillars: this Cornice is very ſéemely, and not confuſed with cutting. The Pedeſtall mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked <hi>B.</hi> ſheweth that of the laſt ſtory, whereof the Baſe marked <hi>M.</hi> doth reſt: alſo the Capitall which ſtandeth aboue, is his companion, and is truly Corinthia, the which is confirmed to the principall, for worke and faſhion, and in my o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, very ſéemely. That Architraue, Fréeſe, and Cornice, marked <hi>A.</hi> ſheweth the laſt Cornice: the Architraue is not vicious, becauſe it hath onely two Facies; for if it had thrée, it would, by the farre diſtance, ſtand cumbred: the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice with the Mutiles, liketh me well, becauſe it hath no Dentiles; and is alſo well deuided with members: neither is it confuſed with much grauing, but hath a ſéemely Proiecture, which heaueth vp the height thereof a little.</p>

                        <p>HAuing ſpoken of many Antiquities, and placed them in Figure; it is requiſite that I alſo ſhew ſome of thoſe that were made in theſe dayes, and ſpecially, of <hi>Bramants</hi> worke, although I haue not altogether omitted it, hauing ſhewed the wonderfull worke of S. <hi>Peters</hi> Church, and other things belonging to holy Temples. And in truth, a man may well ſay, that he reſtored good and perfert Architecture, as yet, by the meanes of <hi>Iulio P. M.</hi> many fayre pieces of worke were made by him in <hi>Rome,</hi> do witneſſe; of the which, this ſet here, is one: this is a Gallery made in <hi>Beluedere,</hi> in the Popes Court, wherein are two fayre things to be ſéene: the one is, the ſtrength thereof; the which, for that the Pilaſters are of ſo great bredth and thickneſſe, will laſt, while the world endureth: the other, for that there are ſo many accompagments ſo well ſet out, with good inuention, and excellent proportion: this worke is meaſured with the ancient Palme. The bredth of the Arches, is <hi>18.</hi> Palmes: and ſo much are the Pilaſters: the bredth of the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſters is deuided into <hi>11.</hi> parts: one part on eyther ſide of the Pilaſter, which beareth the Arch ſhall haue, which is two parts: other two parts ſhall be giuen vnto one Columne, that is <hi>4.</hi> parts: <hi>2.</hi> parts ſhall be giuen to the little Pilaſters of the Niches, or hollow ſeates, and <hi>3.</hi> parts to the Niches themſelues: ſo are the <hi>11.</hi> parts diſtributed. The height of the Pedeſtals ſhall be halfe the wideneſſe of the Pilaſters. The height of the Baſe of the Pedeſtals, ſhall haue one part of the before ſayd <hi>11</hi> parts. The Cornice is the <hi>9.</hi> part leſſe then the Baſe. The height of the Columnes, with Baſes and Capitals, are of <hi>9.</hi> Diameters, and thereunto alſo the ſeuenth part. The Baſe is halfe the thickeneſſe of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnes. The Capitall is of the ſame thickeneſſe: and the ſeuenth part for the Abacus. The height of the Architraue, Fréeſe and Cornice, is as much as the Pedeſtall without his Baſe. And this height is deuided into <hi>11.</hi> parts, foure for the Architraue, <hi>3.</hi> for the Freeſe, becauſe it is vngrauen, and <hi>4.</hi> for the Cornice, as the halfe Circle of the Arch is drawne; then the heights of the lights will be double: after that, the impoſts being drawne in their places, the which are of halfe a Columne thicke, and ſo the Niches or ſeates, and the Quadrans aboue them, haue their certaine proportion.</p>

                        <p>IN the leafe before, I ſhewed a piece of worke of <hi>Bramants</hi> making: and now I will ſhew another of his workes, from whence a wiſe workeman may helpe himſelfe much, by meanes of the diuers and ſundry ornaments that are in it. In this Gallery, the workeman would ſhew thrée ſtories or orders one aboue another, <hi>viz.</hi> Dorica, Ionica, and Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thia: and in trueth, the orders were faire, well ſet out, and placed: notwithſtanding, that the Pilaſters of the firſt ſtory or order being Dorica, were ſomewhat too weake, and the Arches too wide, to the proportion of the Pilaſters; and therewith the weight of the wall of the Ionica order ſtanding vpon it, was an occaſion that it was broken, ruinated and decayed in ſhort time. But <hi>Balthazar</hi> of <hi>Sciene,</hi> a ſkilfull workeman, repayred the decayed ruines, making counter Pilaſters, with vnder-Arches: therefore I haue ſaid, wiſe workemen may learne of this building; not onely to imitate fayre and well made things, but alſo to beware of errors, and alwayes to conſider what wright the nethermoſt ſtory is to ſuſtaine: therefore I counſell a workeman rather to be timerous, then ouer-bold; for if he be timerous, he will alwayes chuſe the ſureſt way, and make his worke with conſideration, and will vſe counſell, yea of ſuch as are leſſe ſkilfull then himſelfe, of whom ſometime men often learne: but if he be high-minded, and truſteth too much to his own ſkill and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, then he will ſcorne another mans counſell, whereby oftentimes he deceyueth and ouer-ſhooteth himſelfe; ſo that oftentimes his worke falleth out badly. Now I will turne to ſpeake of this Gallery, and ſet downe ſome notes of the proportion thereof. The wideneſſe of the Arch ſhall bee deuided into eyght parts, whereof thrée parts ſhall be for the bredth of the Pilaſters, and the height of the Arch ſhall containe <hi>16.</hi> of ſuch parts. The forepart of the Pilaſters ſhall be deuided into foure parts, whereof two parts ſhall be for the Pilaſters of the Arches, and the other two ſhall be for the thickneſſe of the Columnes: the height of the Pedeſtals ſhall containe halfe the wideneſſe of the lights: the height of the Columnes ſhall bee eyght parts of their thickneſſe, with the Baſes and Capitals.

                        <p>AMong other Cities of Italy, Naples is called, <hi>La Gentile,</hi> and that not onely in reſpect of the great Barons, Lords, Earles, Dukes, and great numbers of Gentlemen therein, but alſo, becauſe it is ſo well furniſhed with ſtately Houſes and Palaces, as any other parts of Italy. And among other pleaſant places that are without the Citie, there is a place called Poggio Reale, which King <hi>Alphonſus</hi> cauſed to be made for his pleaſure, in that time (then moſt fortunate) when Italy was in peace, and now vnfortunate, by reaſon of the diſcords therein. This Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace hath a very faire ſcituation, and is well deuided for Roomes, for that in each corner thereof might bee lodged a ſtrong company of men: in the middle there are ſixe great Chambers, beſides the Roomes vnder the ground, together with ſome ſecret Chambers. The forme of this faire building in the ground, as alſo, the building that ſtandeth vpright, is here ſet downe in the next leafe: the meaſure thereof I ſet not downe vnto you, onely, becauſe I will ſhew you the inuention: for a workeman may imagine of what greatneſſe he will haue a Chamber, being all of one greatneſſe; and then from thoſe Chambers he may imagine all the meaſures of the reſt of the building: which building the Noble King vſed for his pleaſure, becauſe men accuſtomed to dwell in the Countrey in the Summer time. The Court of this Palace is compaſſed with double Galleries: and in the middlemoſt place, marked <hi>E.</hi> men go downe a payre of Stayres into a fayre eating place, in which place, the King and his Lords vſed to banquet and eate at pleaſure; in which place he cauſed certayne ſecret places to bee opened, whereby in the twinckling of an eye, the place was full of water, ſo that they ſate all in water: likewiſe at this Kings pleaſure, all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> water voyded out of the roome againe, but there wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted no ſhifts of clothes to put on, nor yet rich and coſtly beds for them to lye in, that would reſt themſelues. O voluptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Italians, how are you impoueriſhed by your diſcords! I will not ſpeake of the moſt beautifull Gardens, filled with all kind of flowres, with diuers compartements of the Orchards and Trées of all kind of Fruits, with great abundance of Fiſh-ponds and Fiſhes, of places and cages of diuers Birds both great and ſmall, of fayre ſtables, filled with all ſorts of Horſes; and of many other fayre things, which I will not ſpeake of, for that <hi>Marcus Antonius Michaell,</hi> a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of that Towne, very learned in Architecture, hath ſéene it, and hath written of it at large in a Latine Epiſtle, which he ſent to a friend of his. But to turne againe to the parts of the ſaid Palace, which is right foure ſquare, it is within, Galleried round about, one aboue the other: in the foure Corners, within the thickneſſe of the walls, ſtand the winding ſtayres to goe vp into the building. The foure Galleries without, marked <hi>B.</hi> are not there, but for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie and beautifying of the houſe, they would ſtand well there.</p>

                        <p>COnſidering the fayre Building of Poggio Real, I haue thought good to ſet downe ſuch an other here in this place; but in other forme for appertements, and peraduenture with more eaſe, for that the places are all of one greatnes, which is not ſo good a forme: but it is neceſſary that the firſt ſhould be greater then the ſecond. In this place I make you no place for lights within, for that it is a place in the countrey, being not cumbred on the ſides; it hath light inough on all the foure corners: but ſome men may ſay, that the Hall with the foure Chambers, becauſe they haue no light but through the galleries, are darke, for it is no perfect couer: to which I anſwere, that the houſe being made to be vſed in the time of great heat, hauing no place in the middle, the Hall and the Chambers will alwayes be cold, by reaſon the Sunne cannot come vnto them. Theſe places will be very pleaſant at none time, for that the ſaid places haue not ſo great lights as the other dwellings; yet haue they ſo much light as they néed: ſuch like may be ſéene in <hi>Bolonia,</hi> which are made in this manner with Galleries, and daily inhabited. This Building is ſo diſpuſed, that the corner places being of great thickeneſſe, the reſt ſhall be ſtrong inough, yea, although the walls had no great thickneſſe, in regard they are all counterforts one to the other, yet ſhall they be of ſufficient ſtrength. I will not ſpeake of the meaſures, for that this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing proportioned, the ſkilful workman may imagine (according to his pleaſure that cauſed it to be built) firſt the greatnes of the roome, then deuide it into ſo many féet or other meaſures, thereby to meaſure all the reſt of the building, as the ſituation of the place may beare it. Then this building, aboue all things, ſhall be placed, that the Sunne may riſe vpon one of the corners, and ſo ſhine vpon all the ſides thereof: for if it ſtands with one ſide to the Eaſt, and the other to the Weſt, then it will follow, that the North ſide ſhall neuer enioy the Sunne-ſhine vpon it, which were rumaticke and vn wholeſome.</p>

I will not trouble my ſelfe to ſpeake of the meaſures nor heights; for in my fourth Booke, in the Order of Corinthia, <hi>O 2.</hi> you ſhal find a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, which, together with the iudgement of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wiſe workman, will ſerue to ſet down this meaſure. And, for that in this Facie there is no ſhortening at all, whereby you may know the Galleries, the flat and cloſed places eche from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; therefore I will ſet downe the two higheſt ſides at eche end: you muſt conceaue it to haue flat Pillars from beneath vpwards; that part betwéene both, which is lower, you muſt ſuppoſe hath two Galleries, one aboue the other, the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnes whereof would be round: the ſame is to be vnderſtood to be both behind, and on both ſides. Men may alſo make aboue the Galleries a Tarrace or Pauement, to defend the raine, the Gallery being made with a Leane-to, or Raile, out of the Cornices of the firſt order of the Figures aforeſayd: and ſo alſo the Hall in the middle, together with the <hi>4.</hi> Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſecond ſtory, would haue more light.

The <hi>1.</hi> is, if you will make the windowes ſo low, that a man ſitting, may eaſily ſée out of them, then (if you ſhould make the windowes no higher then the doore) there would bee too much ſpace betwéene the windowes and the roofe of the houſe, which would greatly darken the houſe: and otherwyſe the windowes bring much more light into the Hall. The <hi>2.</hi> is, that the Chambers by the Hall néed not bee of ſuch height, but you may make hanging Chambers therein, whereto thoſe windowes will ſerue. I might ſpeake of many other things, which I referce to the iudgement of the workeman.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>VItruuius</hi> ſayth, that ſuch as haue built without learning or inſtruction (although workemen) could neuer make any famous or commendable pieces of worke: no more can others, being no workemen, ſuch as haue followed the letter or writing onely, and made no proofe: of which, ſome haue preſumed to father their doings vpon <hi>Vitru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uius:</hi> yet in diuers places of their writings, which are found, they could not cloſe vp their rules orderly, but haue left ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things doubtfull, and (more) haue eſteemed that to be good and commendable, which in worke is not to bee endured. The cauſe of this errour, is, that the laſt Booke of the ſayd <hi>Vitruuius,</hi> wherein the Figures are, was loſt: whereby men might haue knowne and ſound out his meanings: ſo that hereby it appeareth, that ſome Antiquities haue beene very bare in their workes, and eſpecially, in their Orders of Dorica, becauſe <hi>Vitruuius</hi> nameth no Dorica Baſes: but in ſtead thereof, ſpeaketh of an Attica. Now it may be, regarding that he there ſpeaketh not of any Order of Attica, therefore they durſt not make any Dorica Baſes or Columnes: on the contrary, others poſsibly contemning the darkneſſe of the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, (or for want of knowledge) haue ſo far exceeded their Author in many things, that they haue not onely forſaken and left the examples and reaſons of good Antiquities, but alſo (more then that) haue made their workes vnſeemely, and ridiculous to mens eyes, as may be ſeene in diuers antient works: whereby, gentle Reader, many workmen, well ſeene in both, haue beene cumbred therein, and eſpecially in this our time. <hi>Bramant</hi> of <hi>Caſtle Durant, Balthazar</hi> of <hi>Scienne,</hi> and many others, for that (not onely by meanes of <hi>Iulius</hi> the <hi>2.</hi> Pope, but) alſo by others good Architecture was bettered in their times: who, after long diſputation and ſearching of many, aſwell Authors and Commentaries, together with the examples of good Antiquities, haue with authority (to make an end of all doubts) not only added this Spira Attica, of the Dorica, but alſo as many orders as now are vſed, beginning at the Thuſcan, as the groſſeſt and ſlendereſt of all the reſt, and haue reduced the ſame into a certaine and common forme, together with their ornaments and meaſures: which vnles <hi>Sebaſtian Serlius,</hi> a workeman and ſcholer of the ſayd <hi>Balthazar,</hi> hath written, and ſet out in figures; ſo that, leauing the obſcurities of <hi>Vitruuius,</hi> we may make an incorrigible worke. And for that all thoſe that loue workemanſhip, vnderſtand not the Italians, therefore (in my opinion) I haue tranſlated the moſt certayne and beſt rules out of Italian into Dutch, and out of Dutch into Engliſh; onely the names of all Procels, Baſes, Capitals, Cornices, &amp;c. which are not named in Dutch nor Engliſh, for that <hi>Baſtian,</hi> by <hi>Vitruuius</hi> termes, vſeth the common and moderne Italian words, which by ſome ſhould be as hardly vnderſtood as the Latine. But I would commend him, that ſeeing we take vpon vs to follow <hi>Vitruuius</hi> writings, that we giue him the name of <hi>Vitruuius,</hi> that the learned might bee vnderſtood of the workeman, and the workeman alſo vnderſtood of the learned. And for that the worke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man might the better read it, I haue printed it in our ordinary Dutch letter. And although this fourth Booke of ſeuen was firſt ſet out, becauſe it is the beſt, yet the other alſo are no leſſe fit and conuenient to further Architecture or Art of Building, as in the enſuing Epiſtle you ſhall ſee.</p>

                  <p>LOuing and friendly Reader, after I had collected certaine rules of Architecture, thinking that not only<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thoſe of deepe conceyt would vnderſtand them, but that alſo each indifferent man of wit might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue them, as he is more or leſſe addicted to ſuch an Art; which rules are deuided into ſeuen Books, as hereunder ſhall be ſet downe: but for that this Art requireth it, therefore I thought it requiſite to begin with this fourth Booke, and to ſet it out, firſt, which is more to the purpoſe, and more neceſſary then the reſt, for the knowledge of many ſorts of Building and ornaments thereof, to the end that euery one may haue ſome knowledge of this Art, the which is no leſſe pleaſing to the mind of thoſe workmen that thinke vpon things that are to make, then alſo to mens eyes when they are made. Which Art, by the wiſedome of the famous and excellent ſpirits that are now in the world, doth flouriſh in theſe dayes, as the Latine tongue did in the time of <hi>Iulius Caeſar,</hi> and <hi>Cicero.</hi> Then with glad and ioyfull heart receyue at leaſt my good will, (though the effect enſueth not) which, in trueth, I haue (to pleaſure and ſatisfie your minds) in this reſpect.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt Booke, I will entreat of the beginning of Geometry, and of diuers cuttings through of lines, in ſuch ſort, that the workman may yeeld reaſon for that he worketh.</p>
                  <p>In the ſecond Booke, I will ſhew in Figure, and by reaſon, as much of Perſpectiue Art, that if the worke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man will, he may declare his conceyt or purpoſe, by reaſons and figure.</p>
                  <p>In the third Booke, workmen ſhall ſee the Ichnographie, that is, the ground: the Orthographie, that is, the rayſing vp of a Building before. The Scenographie or Sciographie, that is, the inſight, by ſhortening of the moſt part of the Buildings that are in Rome, Italie, &amp;c. diligently meaſured, and ſet by them in writing, with the places where they are, and their names.</p>
                  <p>In the fourth, which is this, I will ſpeake of fiue maner of Buildings, and of their ornaments, as Thuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcana, Dorica, Ionica, Corinthia and Compoſita, that is to ſay, mingled. And by theſe, the whole Arte is learned.</p>
                  <p>In the fift, I will ſpeake of diuers kinds of Temples, ſet downe in diuers formes, that is, round, foure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſquare, ſix-cornerd, eyght-cornerd, Ouall-wiſe, and croſſe-wiſe, with their ground, heights and ſhortenings, diligently meaſured.</p>
                  <p>In the ſixt, I will ſpeake of all dwellings, which, at this day, may bee vſed, beginning at the meaneſt houſe or cotrage, and ſo from degree to degree, proceeding to the moſt rich, fayre and princely Palaces, as well in Countrie villages, as in great Cities or Townes.</p>
                  <p>In the ſeuenth and laſt, ſhall be ſet downe many accidents, which may happen to workemen in diuers places, ſtrange maner of ſituation, repayring of decayed houſes, and how we ſhould helpe our ſelues with pieces of other buildings, with ſuch things as are to be vſed, and at other times haue ſtood in worke.</p>
                  <p>Now then, to proceed readily herein, I will begin with the greateſt and ruſticke order of Building, that is, the Thuſcan, being the playneſt, rudeſt, and ſtrongeſt, and of leaſt grace and ſeemelineſſe.</p>

                  <p>THe ancient workemen in times paſt (as <hi>Vitruvius</hi> affirmeth) dedicated their workes and Buildings to the gods, according to their natures, ſtrength or weakeneſſe; ſo is the forme called Dorica aſcribed to the gods, <hi>Iupiter, Mars,</hi> and valiant <hi>Hercules,</hi> taking ſuch formes from ſtrong men. The forme called Ionica, is aſcribed to the goddeſſe <hi>Diana, Apollo</hi> and <hi>Bacchus,</hi> as of the nature of Matrons, that is, of wiſe &amp; ſenſible women, which are both tender and ſtrong: for <hi>Diana,</hi> by her femurine nature is tender, but by vſing to hunt, ſhee is ſtrong: <hi>Apollo,</hi> by reaſon of his beauty, is tender; but being a man, he is ſtrong: the like of <hi>Bacchus.</hi> But the Corinthia is taken of ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ds, and they aſcribe all to the goddeſſe <hi>Veſta,</hi> and her chaſte mayds: yet at this time I thinke it good to procéed in another ſort, nothing differing from the ancients afore ſayd. My meaning is, to follow the maner and cuſtomes of the Chriſtians, that I (as far as I may) will aſcribe holy Buildings to God and to his Saints: and profane buildings, as well publicke as priuote, I will aſcribe to men according to their profeſſions. So ſay I then, that the Thuſcan maner (after my opinion) is fit for ſtrengths, for Gates of Cities, Townes and Caſtles, places for treaſure, munition and Artillery to kéepe them in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for priſons, hauens of the Sea, and ſuch like things, ſeruing for the warres. It is true, that ruſticke and playns worke, that is, ſuch Buildings as are made of rough ſtones, and others that are made ſomewhat ſmoother, according to the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure which the Stone-cutters take therein, are ſometimes mixed with Dorica, and ſometimes with Dorica and Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thia. Neuertheles, for that the Thuſcan order is the rougheſt ſet foorth, farre more then the other are, I am of opinion, that the Country Bulding is more like vnto the Thuſcan, then any of the reſt: which you may playnely ſée to haue béene obſerued by the Thuſcans, as wel in their chiefe Cities and Townes of <hi>Florence,</hi> as without in their Country Villages, in ſo many rich and fayre Buildings, made after the ruſticall maner, as may be ſéene in all Chriſtendome, mixed with ſuch a ſlight manner of worke, as the workeman thought good. Therefore I conclude, that ſuch Buildings are more agréeable to Thuſcan order, then any other. Therefore, altering ſomewhat from Antiquities, and ſome others of ours, I will in diuers ſorts ſhewe of ſuch workes, <hi>viz.</hi> how to make Gates of Cities, Townes, or Forts; as alſo, in publike and priuate places, Houſes, Galleries, Windowes, Niches or ſeates, hollowed in worke, Bridges, Water-courſes, and ſuch like ſeuerall Ornaments, as may happen into a workemans hands to doe. Men may alſo (not differing from the ancient rules) mixe this ruſticall maner with the Dorica, and alſo with Ionica; and ſometimes with Corinthia, at the pleaſure of thoſe that ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ke to pleaſe their owne fantaſies, which a man may affirme to bee more for pleaſure then profit: therefore the workeman ought to procéede with good aduice, eſpecially in publike buildings, wherein comelineſſe is commendable.</p>
                  <p>In the beginning of this Booke, I obſerued the Comedians order, who (when they intend to play any Comedy) firſt ſend out a Prologue, who in few wordes giueth the audience to vnderſtand what they intend to entreat of, in their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie. So I, meaning in this Booke to entreat of fiue maner of Buildings, <hi>viz.</hi> Thuſcan, Dorica, Ionica, Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thia and Compoſita, haue thought good, that in the beginning thereof, men ſhould ſée the Figures of all the ſeueral kinds whereof I purpoſe to entreat of. And although that in the Columnes and their ornaments, all the meaſures and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions are not ſet downe, but onely the principall, by generall rules; yet will I not fayle, as occaſion ſhall ſerue, to ſet them downe in particularities: but this is done, as I ſayde, to ſhew in generall rules for an Introduction onely, the better to be vnderſtood of euery workeman, and in the beginning will obſerue <hi>Vitruuius</hi> order and termes, marked on the ſides with <hi>A. B. C.</hi> that euery workeman may name them according to his country ſpéech. And firſt, the Stilo bato, or Thuſcan Pedeſtall, I meane the flat, without Crowne or Baſe, ſhall bee a perfect foureſquare. The perfect Dorica ſhall be as much more as the drawing of a liue from corner to corner, of the perfect foureſquare, placing it vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right. The Pedeſtall Ionica, ſhall be of one foureſquare and an halfe: the Pedeſtall Corinthia, ſhall be a foureſquare and two third parts thereof. The Pedeſtall Compoſita ſhall bee of two perfect foureſquares. Alſo, wonder not, that the Chapter next enſuing is the fiſt, which others would eſtéeme the firſt; for that the firſt Booke doeth contayn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>IN <hi>Vitruuius</hi> fourth Booke and ſeuenth Chapter, we find, that a man ſhould make a Thuſcan Columne of ſeuen parts high, with Capitall and Baſe, which meaſure ſhould be taken from the thickneſſe of the Columne below. The height of the Baſes or Baſement, ſhould be the halfe of the thickneſſe of the Columne, which ſhall bee deuided into two equall parts, whereof one ſhall be the Plinthus, the other deuided in three, two parts thereof ſhall bee the Thorus, the third the Circle, The Proiecture you ſhall make in this maner: Firſt, make a Circle as great as the Columne is thicke below, placing it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap> a foureſquare: without the foureſquare drew another Circle, cloſe about the corners of the foureſquare, which ſhall bee the Proiecture. And although all other Baſes haue their Plinthus foureſquare, yet this of Thuſ, can muſt beround, as <hi>Vitruuius</hi> teacheth. The height of the Capitall muſt bee like the Baſe: that deuide into three parts: one part ſhall be the Abacus: the other ſhall bedeuided in foure parts, three for the Echino, the fourth for the Annulo or Cintho, which may be called a Girdle, Band, or Liſt in Engliſh. The third part reſting; ſhall bee for the Hypotrachalium, or Freeſe. The Aſtragal with the Cincta, is halfe the Freeſe; but that deuided in three, two ſhall be for the Round, the third his Liſt, the hearing out muſt bee as the height: and although this Liſt is there named with the Capitall, yet it is a part of the Columne, which Columne ought to be made thinner aboue a fourth part; alſo the Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall in the vppermoſt part ſhall not be greater then the Columne below. The maner to leſſen the Columne is thus: Let the body of the Columne be deuided in three parts: the third part below ſhall hang at the leade, and the other two third parts you ſhall deuide into as many equall parts as you will: then at the third part of the columne draw halfe a Circle, and from the liues that hang there, from the outtermoſt corners of the Capitall inwards, meaſure the eyght part, which in all ſhall be a fourth part: from vnder the corner (where the Columne is thinneſt) you ſhall draw two lines by a leade, to the halfe circle, and thoſe parts of the circle outwards, you ſhall ſet below, in as many euen parts as the two third parts of the Columne holdeth: which being done on both ſides, then there ſhall be as many Paralels or croſſe lines, drawen from the one poynt of the halfe circle to the other, each line being marked with number, from the top downewards, and the like vpon the lynes that deuide the Columnes; which numbers being orderly placed, then it is certayne, that the firſt line ſhall agree with the thinneſt part of the Columne aboue: after, take the ſecond line of the halfe circle, and ſet it vpon the ſecond line of the Columne, then the third vpon the third, and the fourth vpon the fourth: when that is done, there muſt be a lyne drawne from the Baſe of the halfe circle, to the lyne <hi>4.</hi> and from the lyne <hi>4.</hi> to the lyne <hi>3.</hi> and from the line <hi>3.</hi> to the lyne <hi>2.</hi> and from the line <hi>2.</hi> to the lyne <hi>1.</hi> alſo a lyne: and ſo from the ſecond ſide of the columne: and although that the lynes in themſelues are right, yet they make a crooked lyne, which the iudicious workeman knoweth how to regeire and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate at his will on all ſides in the gathering of the lynes. And although this rule is made for the Thuſcan Columne, which is leſſned aboue a fourth part, yet it may ſerue for all ſorts of Columnes; and the more the deuiding of the Columnes and the halfe Circle are in number, ſo much the leſſening will dimyniſh.</hi>

But I will ſhew you, that when the Gates of the Citie, Towne or Fortreſſe are placed, how men, in my opinion, ſhould ſet them forth, ſetting down ſome Figures thereof. You muſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that each Gate or Port is to bee after the Italian maner, and ought, of neceſſity, to haue a Poſterne Gate, which are called <hi>Porten van Secourſe,</hi> which are the ſmall Ports on the ſides. But to obſerue the Semetry, that is, a due meaſure, they ought to be made in this manner. The meaſure of the Gate is thus, as much as the bredth of the light ſhall be, the halfe whereof ſhall ſerue for the height. The bredth of the light is deuided into ſixe parts, whereof one part ſhall be for the bredth of the Pilaſters on eyther ſide of the Gate: the flat of the Pillars thereof ſhall be as broad as the third part of the light, and the height, with Capitals and Baſes. The height of the Baſes ſhall be a third part of the bredth of the Pillars, and ſo much alſo the Capitals, obſeruing the rule ſet downe in the firſt Columne.

Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the one Pillar and the other, the Poſternes or ſmall Gates ſhall bee, and the wideneſſe ſhall bee as broad as the flat Pillars. The height ſhall be twice as much as the bredth: the Pilaſters ſhall be the third part of the ſayd Poſterne. The eleuation or rayſing vp aboue the gate, ſhall bee at the workemans will. But the proportion of the Faſtigies or Frontiſpicie (which is called with vs, the ſpanning, couer, or roofe) I will ſhew in two ſorts in the order of Dorica.</p>

The Pilaſters ſhall be the <hi>8.</hi> part of the wideneſſe of the Gate: and the Columnes ſtand for the round Columnes and flat Pillars, bring the fourth part of the Gate. But for that the Columne is a third part ſet into the wall, and is bound faſt with other ſtones, more for ſhew then bearing, it is to be made <hi>7.</hi> parts high, and alſo of <hi>8.</hi> at the workemans will, which will ſet foorth the Gate with more ſhew. The wideneſſe of the Poſterne ſhalbe the halfe of the middle Gate, the Pilaſters alſo (as the greater) that is the halfe. The height thereof ſhalbe ſuch as the Facie that beareth the Arch, and it ſhalbe the Supercilie, or Architraue thereof, as we call it: and if you find not a ſtone all of one péece fit for it, then you ſhall make the Cunei or Pennants as you ſée them heere in the Figure.

                     <p>IT is an excellent thing in a workeman to be full of inuention, in regard of the diuerſitie of accidents which belong vnto building: for ſometimes a man ſhall find ſtore of Columnes, but ſo low or ſhort, that they ſerue not for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, for which men would vſe them vnto, vnleſſe the workeman deuiſe ſome meanes to helpe them. Therefore, if the Columne be not ſo high as it will reach to the Facie, that lyeth like y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> roofe of this Gallery, then with thoſe maner of Pennants a man may rayſe it higher, if on both ſides it hath good ſtrong ſhoulders: touching the wayght aboue, it will be very chargeable, therefore to make it without binding of iron barres, it would not be ſure: but it is leſſe to be feared, if the Gallery were not ſo broad, but that it might be couered with ſtones that were all of one piece, or elſe to make ſtrong beames therein. The proportion hereof ſhall be, that the wideneſſe of the Arches ſhalbe the thickneſſe of <hi>4.</hi> Columnes, and the height twiſe as much.

The proportion is, that the wideneſſe from one Pilaſter to another, and alſo the height, ſhall be to the Facie that beareth the Arch. The Facie ſhall be the ſeuenth part of that wideneſſe or height: from the Facie downewards is deuided into ſixe parts: the halfe Circle into nine parts and a quarter; for the cloſing ſtone is the fourth part more then the other: the reſt may be found with the Compaſſe.</p>

                     <p>THe Ancients (as we haue heard) conſidering the ſtate of their gods, ordained Dorica worke, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated the ſame to <hi>Iupiter, Mars,</hi> and <hi>Hercules:</hi> but we build Temples, and dedicate them to <hi>Chriſt, Paul, Gregory,</hi> and ſuch holy perſonages, that were not onely profeſſed Souldiers, but alſo valiantly and boldly loſt their liues, and ſhed their bloud for the faith of CHRIST. All ſuch belong to Dorica, and not to their gods onely, but to men of armes, and ſtrong perſonages, being of qualitie more or leſſe: for whom, if a workeman make or build houſes or palaces, they muſt be Dorica: and the nobler the man is for whom ſuch worke is done, the ſtronger and ſtatelyer they ought to be; and the more effeminate that they are, the more ſlenderer and pleaſanter the building ſhall be, as I will ſhew when time ſerueth. But now we will come to the maner of the worke. <hi>Vitruuius</hi> ſpeaketh of this Dorica worke, in his fourth Booke and third Chapter: but touching Baſes of Columnes, hee ſpeaketh thereof in his third Booke; although ſome are of opinion, that he ſpeaketh &amp; meaneth of the Baſes of Corinthia, for that they haue bene much vſed on the Corinthia Columnes, and Ionica. And ſome alſo thinke, that Dorica Columnes had no Baſes, hauing reſpect to many ancient buildings; as the Theater of <hi>Marcellus,</hi> one of the fayreſt workes in <hi>Italy,</hi> being the middle downewards Dorica: which Columnes had no Baſes, the body of the Columnes reſting vpon a ſtep, without any other ſupport. There is at <hi>Carcer Tulliano</hi> the ſignes of a Doricall Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the Columnes whereof are without Baſes. You may alſo ſee in <hi>Verona</hi> an Arch tryumphant, of Dorica worke, where the Columnes are without Baſes. Neuertheleſſe, for that workemen haue in former times made the Corinthia Baſes in another maner, as I will ſhew hereafter: Therefore I affirme, that the Baſes Atticurga, which <hi>Vitruuius,</hi> in his third Booke, ſo nameth, are the Dorica Baſes: and this wee ſee, <hi>Bramant</hi> hath obſerued in his Buildings which he made in <hi>Rome:</hi> which <hi>Bramant,</hi> being the light and Inuentor of good and true Architecture, which from Antiquitie to his time (being vnder Pope <hi>Iulius</hi> the ſecond) had beene hidden, we ought to beleeue. Then this Baſe of Dorica ſhall be the height of halfe the thickneſſe of a Columne: the Plinthus the third part of his height: of the reſt there ſhalbe foure parts made; one ſhall be for the Thorus aboue: the other three ſhall be ſet in <hi>3.</hi> euen parts: the one for the Thorus aboue, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond for the Trochile or Scotia: but the ſame being deuided in ſeuen parts, one part ſhall be the vppermoſt liſt, and another the vndermoſt. The Proiecture or bearing out of the Baſe, ſhall be of halfe the height, and ſo ſhall the Plinthus of each Facie hold a thickneſſe and a halfe of the Columne. And if the Baſe ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth below our ſight, the corner vnder the vppermoſt Thorus, (being of it ſelfe darkened) ought to bee ſomewhat lower then the other. But if the Baſe ſtandeth aboue our ſight, the corner aboue the nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Thorus (alſo of it ſelfe darkened) ſhall be greater then the other. Thereto alſo the Scotia, darkened by the Thorus, in ſuch caſe ſhalbe made more then the meaſure appoynted. And in ſuch caſes the worke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man muſt be iudicious and wary, as <hi>Vitruuius</hi> would haue him to bee learned in the Mathematicall ſcience, that doth ſtudy his Booke.</p>

The Echinus ſhall alſo be deuided in <hi>3.</hi> parts, and <hi>2.</hi> third parts being for the Echinus, and the reſt for the Annulo, which ſhall alſo be deuided in <hi>3.</hi> parts, giuing each of them one. The Fréeſe ſhall bee as the others. The Proiecture of each part ſhalbe like the height: and ſo doing, it ſhall bee made by more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine rules, better, and more eaſily for ſhew.</p>

                     <p>VPon the Capitall you place the Epiſtilia or Architraue, the height whereof ſhall be one Modell, and deuided in <hi>7.</hi> parts, one ſhall be the Tenia or Liſt: the Guttes or ſmall Liſts vnder the Tenia (which <hi>Vitruuius</hi> nameth Sub tenia) are in all, the ſixt part of a modell: which height being deuided into <hi>4.</hi> parts, the <hi>3.</hi> parts ſhall bee the Guttes, and the other the Liſt. The Guttes ſhall bee ſixe in number, hanging vnder the Trigliphes. The height of the Trigliphes or Trigliffe ſhall be one Modell and an halfe, and the bredth one Modell: which bredth deuided in <hi>12.</hi> on eyther ſide there ſhall be one left for the halfe Channels or hollowings, and of the <hi>10.</hi> parts reſting, <hi>6.</hi> ſhall bee for the flat of the Trigliphes, and <hi>4.</hi> for the Channels or hollowing in the middle. And from the one Trigliph to the other, there ſhall be the ſpace of a Modell and a halfe: which ſpace ſhall be right <hi>4.</hi> ſquare (by <hi>Vitruuius</hi> named, Metho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha.) In which ſpaces, us you pleaſe, you may ſet, cut, or graue, Oxe heads, with Diſhes; and that, not without ſecret ſignification. For in ancient time, when the vnbeléeuing folke ſacrificed Oxen, they alſo vſed Diſhes, &amp; Platters there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, placing ſuch things round about their Temples for ornaments. Vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Trigliphs, you muſt place their Capitals: the height whereof ſhall be one ſixt part of a Modell. Aboue the Trigliphs or their Capitals, the Corona muſt bee pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced with <hi>2.</hi> Cimaties, the one aboue, the other below: and they both together deuided into <hi>5.</hi> parts, <hi>3.</hi> for the Corona, and two for the Cimaties. But the height of them all, ſhalbe of halfe a Modell: vpon the Corona, you muſt place the Scima: the height whereof is halfe a Modell, and to it you muſt adde one eyght part for the Liſt thereof aboue. The Protecture of the Corona ſhall bee of <hi>3.</hi> parts: two be in one Modell: in the ground of the Corona, right aboue the Trigliphes, the Guttes were orderly ſet, as you ſée them in the Figure hanging beſide. Alſo, betwéene the Trigliphes are cut Fulmines, that is, winged lightning: or you may leaue the ſpacies bare. The Proiecture or bearing out of the Scuna muſt be like the height thereof: euen ſo, each part of the bearing out of the Corona ſhall haue their Proiecture like their height. But the more Proiecture the Corona hath, if the ſtone may beare it, the more ſtatelyer it ſheweth. This, we ſée, that the ancient Romanes did obſerue, as ſhall be ſhewed when time ſerueth, both in Figure and meaſure.</p>

                     <p>THe parts of the Trigliphes and Methophes being in this order vnprepared, and yet very neceſſary, I will take paynes to declare ſo well as I can. Firſt, although <hi>Vitruuius</hi> affirmeth, that the Models of the worke Heraſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>los, <hi>viz.</hi> of ſixe Columnes, may be diſtributed and deuided into <hi>35.</hi> parts: yet I find not, that the parts may ſtand ſo, for this cauſe, that giuing the middlemoſt inter-Columne <hi>4.</hi> Methophes, and the other ſpaces <hi>3.</hi> the ſayd num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber will not make the whole: but, as I conceaue, if you ſet <hi>42.</hi> as you may ſée and reckon in this Figure following, as alſo in the worke Thetruſtilos, that is, of <hi>4.</hi> Columnes: the Booke ſaith, that the Forefront of the whole worke ſhould be deuided into <hi>23.</hi> parts, which, I aſſure you, cannot ſtand ſo, if you will giue the middle ſpace <hi>4.</hi> Methophes, and the other two eche of them <hi>3.</hi> But, by my aduice, there ſhould be <hi>27.</hi> as you may ſée in the Figure following. Then, if the principall of the Temples be deuided into <hi>27.</hi> parts, the Columnes ſhall bee <hi>2.</hi> Models thicke, the middlemoſt inter, Columnes ſhall be of <hi>8.</hi> Models, that is, the thickneſſe of <hi>4.</hi> Columnes, and the inter-Columnes beſides, ſhalbe each of <hi>5.</hi> Models and an halfe, that is, two and a quarter, and a quarter and halfe: and ſo ſhall the <hi>27.</hi> bee diſtributed. And aboue each Columne his Trigliph being ſet, &amp; the Trigliphes deuided with Methophes, according to the rule afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayd: then the middlemoſt ſpace ſhall haue <hi>4.</hi> Methophes, and thoſe on the ſides ſhall haue <hi>3.</hi> The height of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumne, Capitall and Architraue, &amp;c. ſhall be alſo made according to the rule: but the height of the Faſtigium or Geuell ſhall bee the ninth part of the length of the Cimatie, that is aboue the Corona, ſetting the meaſures vnder the <hi>A.</hi> vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to the vndermoſt Cimatie of the Corona <hi>B.</hi> The Acroteria or Pedeſtall marked <hi>A.</hi> vpon the Faſtigium ſhalbe halfe the height of the Faſtigium or Geuell, that is, of the euen or flat, which <hi>Vitruuius</hi> calleth Timpanum, and they ſhall be as broad as the Columne is aboue, and the middlemoſt muſt be an <hi>8.</hi> part higher then the other. And for that this Doore or Gate is of Dorica, and is hard to be vnderſtood, therefore I will ſhew in the beſt ſort I can, both in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and Figure. <hi>Vitruuius</hi> ſaith, that from the Pauement to the Lacunary, that is, from the ground of the Gallery, to the roofe of the ſame vnder <hi>A.</hi> muſt be deuided into thrée parts and an halfe, and two parts ſhall be for the height of the lights: ſo ſayth my Author, in my opinion.

But here I let my ſelfe to vnderſtand, that the meaning of the Author is broken, where he ſayth, Sima Sculptura: he would haue ſayd, Sine Sculptura, that is, without cutting or grauing; and that is, Cimatium Doricum, together, with the Aſtragalum Leſbium: the proportion whereof ſtandeth in the Figure marked <hi>A. D.</hi> Now, for that the text ſaith, that the Cimatie of the Corona ſhalbe of like height of the vppermoſt of the Capitals, which being ſo, then the Corona will be very great: to which (according to the Authors meaning) I haue giuen as much Proiecture as the height of the Supercilie is. Although ſuch Crownes will neuer be handſome or ſéemely in worke, neuertheleſſe, to intreat of the Ornaments, I thought good to ſet downe my opinion herein, and to ſhew it in Figure.</p>

For where <hi>Vitruuius</hi> ſaith, that you muſt deuide the part from the Pauement to the Lacunary in <hi>3.</hi> parts and an halfe, it muſt be vnderſtood, aboue towards the Timpanum marked <hi>B.</hi> and then the doore would bee well, and the Corona would be like the Plinthus of the Capitall.

                        <p>ALteration oftentimes is better and more eſtéemed, then perfect ſimple forme in her owne nature: therefore it is the more pleaſing, when a piece of worke is made of diuers members and parts, although of like nature, as you may perceyue in the Figure following, wherein there are Trigliphs and Mutiles, all in one order: which, in effect, I neuer ſaw in any Antiquities or writings.

This part ſhall haue the light double proportioned; but the Pilaſter ſhall be the <hi>7.</hi> part of the height, and the Supercilies the halfe thereof. The bredth of the Trigliphes and Mutiles, is the halfe of the Supercilies, and the height a double bredth, making <hi>2.</hi> Mutiles ouer one Pilaſter, and <hi>4.</hi> Trigliphs ouer the Doore: the ſpaces ſhall be all <hi>4.</hi> ſquare.

The Proiecture of the Scima and the Cimatie, ſhall be each according to their height. That Faſtigium in the higheſt part, ſhall be a fift part of the wideneſſe, from the one corner of the Scima in the right line, to the other.</p>

                        <p>MY meaning was, in the beginning of this Booke, to ſpeake onely of the ornaments of the fiue Orders of Buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, as of Columnes, Pedeſtals, Epiſtiliums, Zophorus, Cornices, Gates, Windowes, Niches, &amp; ſuch like things. But, after that I determined to augment and enrich this Volumne, in ſhewing diuers Facies or fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts of Edificies, Temples, Palaces and Houſes, &amp;c. And for that, when as the Columne ſtandeth vpon the ground, they are commendable; yet oftentimes it falleth out, that men haue not their Columnes thicke inough, nor long inough, as they deſire, ſo that it is neceſſary to place Pedeſtals vnder them: therefore I haue made this order fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, the proportion whereof ſhall be as followeth: that the wideneſſe ſhall be double in the height: the Pilaſter with the Arch, ſhalbe a <hi>12.</hi> part of the wideneſſe: the Columne as thicke againe: the inter-Columne halfe the wideneſſe of the light or Doore: the wideneſſe of the Niches, <hi>2.</hi> Columnes thicke, and <hi>4.</hi> in height: the Pedeſtals, <hi>4.</hi> Columnes thicke in height: his bredth, and the reſt, as is before ſayd. The Columne, with the Baſe and Capitall, ſhalbe <hi>9.</hi> parts high: the Epiſtilium is halfe a Columne thicke: the Trigliph of the ſame bredth, and twice ſo high with the Capitall. The Trigliphes placed as you ſée them, the Corona and the reſt of the members ſhalbe made as is before ſhewne. The height of theſe Geuels ſomewhat excéed <hi>Vitruuius</hi> writings: but I haue ſéen ſuch an other, ſomewhat higher, in Antiquities, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made of the ſixt part of the Corona in length. The Acroteria ſhalbe of height and bredth like the Columne aboue, without Cornice: and the middlemoſt a ſixt part higher, as alſo the Columne a <hi>9.</hi> part, being made faſt in the wall.</p>

                        <p>ALthough in Antiquities, as farre as is found, when workemen had placed the Epiſtilia vpon the round Columne, they ſet nothing elſe but the Faſtigium vpon that, vſing the ſome order in Churches and Temples, and not in any other buildings: Neuertheleſſe, I will not omit to ſet downe ſome maner of Houſes without Arches: for if you will make Arches with their foureſquare Pillars and round Columnes before them for beautifying of the worke, ſéeking to make much light in your Callerie, the Pillars with the Arches will hinder a great deale of light: Then if you will ſet the Arches onely vpon the round Columnes, that were altogether falſe, for that the foure corners of the Arch would ſurpaſſe the roundneſſe or body of the Columnes: therefore I intend, to make ſome Houſes and other Buildings without Arches, both of this order, and alſo of the other. This ſhall therefore be made in this maner, that the greateſt inter Columne ſhall be the thickneſſe of foure Columnes, and the ſmalleſt of one and an halfe. The height of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnes ſhall be of nine parts, with Baſes and Capitals: the Architraue, Fréeſe, and Cornice, &amp;c. ſhall bee made accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the former rule: the wideneſſe of the windowes are of two Columnes thicknes: the height a foureſquare and two third parts: and their Pilaſters one ſixt part of the light, hauing the Cornice aboue, like the Capitall. The doore ſhall be of the bredth of thrée Columnes, and ſeuen in height: and ſo ſhall the lights of the windowes, and of the doores, bee all one height. The Trigliphes and Methophes ſhall bee deuided, as you may perceiue. The ſecond ſtory ſhall bee leſſe or ſhorter by a fourth part, according as <hi>Vitruuius</hi> giueth counſell: ſo alſo, ſhall the Architraue, Fréeſe, and Cornice bee a fourth part leſſened: the windowes thereof, with the Pilaſters, ſhould bee as broad as the loweſt.

                        <p>FOr that ſometimes, ſome men will haue altogether Arches and Galleries, and for that it is confuſed worke, to place Arches vpon round Columnes, yet a man may make foureſquare Pillars vnder them with Baſes and Capitals, like the other. And although this houſe is whole, which is but little for a man that hath a great liuing, yet you may ſet it foorth in <hi>5.</hi> Arches, alſo in <hi>7.</hi> Arches. The Deuiſion whereof may be, that each Intercolumne may be of the thickneſſe of foure Columnes. The height of the Columnes with Baſes and Capitals of ſixe parts: and aboue them the Arches to be ſet of the bredth before, of halfe a Columne: the openneſſe ſhall bee of double proportion. Aboue the Arches you muſt place the Architraue, Fréeſe, and Cornice: the height of them all ſhalbe of <hi>2.</hi> Columnes thickneſſe: and being deuided in <hi>3.</hi> parts and a halfe, one part ſhalbe the Architraue, halfe a part for the Fréſe, and one part for the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice: for the other part, you ſhall follow the rule aforeſayd. The doore ſhalbe two Columnes outward: the Pilaſter, the ſixt part of the light: but the Cornices of the doore, and the windowes, ſhall haue the height of the Capitals. The win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes ſhalbe a Columne and a halfe bearing out: and their length or height, ſhall be taken in Diagonall maner. The corner Columnes ſhalbe as broad as the other: but they ſhalbe of <hi>8.</hi> parts and a halfe high. The ſecond ſtory aboue this, ſhalbe a fourth part leſſe: the corner Columnes, with Architraue, Fréeſe and Cornice, leſſened accordingly: The windowes aboue the Arches, with the Pilaſters, ſtalbe as wide as thoſe below: but the height of the <hi>2.</hi> foureſquares, and the Fréeſe aboue them, ſhall bee as broad as the Supercilium: the Cornice alſo as much: The ſmall windowes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone them, are made for two purpoſes: The firſt, the Romes being high, as they ſhew outwardly, will make the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers and other roomes much lighter. Secondly, for neceſſity a man map make hanging chambers in them, and then thoſe lights will ſerue to good purpoſe. The third ſtory ſhalbe leſſe then the ſecond a fourth part: and the ſame being deuided in <hi>5.</hi> parts, one part ſhalbe for the Architraue, Fréeſe and Cornice: and that part deuided in <hi>3.</hi> one part ſhalbe for the Architraue and Fréeſe, and the third for the Cornice: and in the Fréeſe, the Mutiles and Mogdilions ſhalbe deuided, as you ſée them. The lights of the windowes ſhalbe as the others, but they ſhall bee a twelfth part higher, becauſe they are further from the ſight: the Pilaſters, Fréeſe and Cornice, ſhalbe like the other. The Frontiſpice and Arches ſhall be made, as I haue ſayd, in the doores and gates of the Order of the Dorica: for beautifying, or to place another row of Arches in it, you may ſet Acroteries or Pilaſters vpon them, which will paſſe well in the making of their fire places, or chimneyes for anoyding of ſmoke. The ſpaces betwéene the windowes, that remayne white, are left to bee paynted, as the workeman will, or at the pleaſure of the owner of the houſe.

Aboue the firſt order, as you ſhall make a Podium of a Columne &amp; an halfe high, whereon you muſt ſet the Columnes in order (as it is taught) the height without the Podium ſhall be deuided in <hi>5.</hi> parts, whereof <hi>4.</hi> ſhall bee for the Columnes, the other for their ornaments, whereof the Trigliphes ſhalbe deuided, as you ſée, obſeruing the rule aforſayd.

                        <p>BEfore, I hane ſhewed in two figures, how to make the Facies or forefronts of Houſes after the Venetians maner: but for that in ſuch works men would willingly haue ſome places bearing out, which are, for the moſt part, made o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the water, for freſh ayre of the water, whereon the moſt part of buildings haue their fayreſt forefronts or Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies; as alſo, to ſée the tryumphes oftentimes made there in Boates and Ships: to which purpoſe, the ſayd bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings or iuttyings out ſerue well, and yet neuertheleſſe, are vnſéemely things, and haue no other ſupporters but the Mogdilions: Now, ſuch things as haue not their foundation ſtrongly layd and made, hurt the walles of the houſe or building, whereof ancient workemen were very carefull, and made no ſuch bearing out, but onely Cornices: therefore I ſay, if a man will make any ſuch things in any building with good aduice, it is neceſſary that the firſt wall ſhould bee ſo thicke, that it may ſtand ſo farre out as the flat of the bearing out requireth, as may bee perceyued in the round: and for that the middlamoſt wall ſtandeth out more then the ſides, if you will not make it ſo thicks, then you may make a ſtrong Arch within, to vphold the middlemoſt, although it be hollow and of ſmall weyght. This bearing out, is to bee vnderſtood aboue the Facies of the ruſticall worke: which being made, then the compartement of the Facies ſhall bee aboue this, ſo that the middlemoſt part ſhall be of thrée portions, and the ſides of thrée and an halfe, I meane within the walles, as the ground ſheweth.

The Capitals of the Mutiles and Trigliphes, ſhall bee ſo high as halfe the bredth of the Trigliphes. The Corona, with the Scimatie and Scima, ſhall bee ſo high as the Architraue; and being deuides in two parts, one part ſhall be for the Corona; of the other you muſt make thrée parts, one for the Cimatie with the Liſt, the other ſhall be for the Scima with his Liſt. The bearing out of the Corona ſhall be ſo great or little, that the ſpaces betwéene the Capitals of the Trigliphes in the ground of the Corona, may be foureſquare, for that, if men will ſit round about it, they may haue their place of ſight. The Prdiecture of the Scima with the Cimatie, ſhalbe made like that height which ſtandeth aboue, at the diſcretion of the workeman. But if the Chimney be very ſmall for a little roome or Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, then a man ſhall make the Pilaſter of the ſeuenth part of the height of the opening.</p>

But if you will make ſuch Modiglions all of one bredth, I would commend it in a great worke, for that the vndermoſt drawing to the wall, &amp; going from our ſight, leſſen themſelues: for that the part which receaueth the ſmoke, is Piramides-wiſe, which wil not ſtand well in a great height. You may ſet it vpon the firſt Cornice higher or lower, as you will, or according to the ſituation of the place. This buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of Chimneyes may be made in great forme: but if you will make them ſmall, then you ſhall deuide the height from the Pauement to the Architraue in <hi>5.</hi> parts, whereof one ſhall be for the Cornice: the bredth of the Modiglions ſhall be the ninth part of that height, the Capitall of halfe the bredth: and thus it will bee more ſeemely in amndifferent meane forme.

But we that are Chriſtians, hauing a Temple to make of this worke, we will dedicate it to ſuch Saints as are of nature, eyther weake or ſtrong: ſo likewiſe, common workes are fit for peaceable people, men, neyther great workemen, nor all too ſimple in workemanſhip: and ſuch workemen are fitteſt for ſuch worke. Now let vs come to the meaſures: the Ionica Columne, by a common rule, muſt be of 8. parts, with Capitall and Baſe: although that <hi>Vitruuius</hi> ſayth, it muſt be of 8. parts and an halfe; ſo may men ſometimes make it of 9. parts and more, as ſome indifferent workemen haue affirmed. But this, I ſay, ſhall be made of 8. parts, which muſt hold his thickneſſe below, and ſo ſhall their Baſes be of halfe the ſame thickenes, which <hi>Vitruuius</hi> ſetteth downe diligently, in the 3.

The Proiecture on eyther ſide, ſhall be one eyght part, and one fixt part: ſo that the Plinthus on eyther ſide ſhall be one fourth part, and one eyght part more then the thickeneſſe of the Columnes. Now, for that the Cincte or Liſt is ſuppreſſed by the greatnes of the Thorus, I am perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that it ought to be made the halfe greater then the other.

                        <p>LOuing Reader, there are many things which cannot fully, from poynt to poynt, bee ſhewed in Figure, vnleſſe the workeman muſt helpe himſelfe by practiſe, like as the Cincte or band of theſe Volutes: which (if the Capitall bee very great) will ſtand well: if the bredth contayneth the fourth part of the eye, and if the Capitall bee of indifferent greatneſſe, then it muſt be made of a third part of the eye: but if the Capitall be ſmall, then it muſt bee the halfe of the eye, alwayes at the workemans diſcretion: for I haue ſéene it ſo in Antiquities, although they differ. The thickneſſe being marked aboue, vnder the Abacus, then you muſt place the Compaſſe a little below the figure <hi>1.</hi> from aboue the Catheta downe wards: then agayne, you muſt place the Compaſſe a little aboue the figure <hi>2.</hi> drawing your line from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath vpwards to the Catheta.</p>
                        <p>Now, whereas I haue ſayd, that the laſt Booke promiſed by <hi>Vitruuius,</hi> is not found, by meanes whereof, diuers opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions are ſpred abroad touching the ſame, ſome affirming, that in <hi>Vitruuius</hi> time, there were many vnſkilfull worke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men (as there are now alſo) hauing better fortune, then good vnderſtanding: (others) that preſumption, ſiſter to vnſkil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe, beareth ſuch ſway among common workemen, that vnderſtand not themſelues, it is thought, that <hi>Vitruuius</hi> refuſed, or at leaſt, would not publiſh it, in regard of the vnthankfulneſſe of ſuch as neglect good learning. Some alſo affirme, that it was too hard a matter for him to place them in figures; which I can hardly iudge to bee the mind of ſuch an Author. But whereas ſome affirme, that this laſt Booke was ſo pleaſing and acceptable, in regard of the figures there at large ſet out, and he being ouer-carefull in looking vnto it, was robbed thereof, among other riches and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, by vnſkilfull perſons: this I beléeue beſt, is as warre, which is enemy to all good Artes, which yet, at this day, is eſpecially to be lamented, for that men by the figures, might haue made diuerſities of worke in the right maner.</p>

                        <p>ALthough the height of this Arch is not of double proportion, as the moſt part of thoſe which I haue ſhewed, yet it is not falſe, but is made by good diſcretion, for that it may ſometime fall out, that in the compartition of a Facies, vpon occaſion of any neceſſary height, and to make the Arches vnequall, which ſhould be ſo to place the principall gate in the middle, which in ſuch caſe ſhould not attayne to ſuch height: but if we be not conſtrayned by any ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, I more commend the double height, then any other proportion.

The Frontiſpice ſhalbe made according to a rule ſet downe in the Dorica: the Architraue, Fréeſe and Cornice ſhalbe made in height, of the fourth part of the heights of the Columnes, by the rule a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſayd.

                        <p>SOmetime, as is ſayd, a workeman ſhall find a great number of Columnes, but ſo low, that they will not reach high inough for his worke, if he cannot helpe himſelfe therewith, and apply ſuch members, to ſerue the building which he hath in hand: therefore if the height of the Gallery riſeth higher then the Columnes, then in the middle of the Facie you may make an Arch, being vpholden by the Architraue, which ſhalbe aboue the Columnes, which Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traue ſhall bee the Impoſt or vpholding of a round roofe. But where the Arch ſhall be, there ſhall be a Crociere, as the workeman may ſee in this ground: and for ſtrengthening thereof, let there be Iron or mettall barres layd ouer, as it is taught in the Dorica Order. But the deuiding of this Facie ſhalbe ſuch, that the middlemoſt Intercolumne ſhalbe of <hi>6.</hi> Columnes thickneſſe: and the height of the Columne, with Baſes and Capitals ſhalbe of <hi>8.</hi> parts: the Architraue holdeth as much as the Columne is in thickneſſe aboue: likewiſe the Arch: aboue the which the workeman ſhall make a Cornice, which height ſhall hold a fourth part more then the Architraue, without the Thorus vnder, with the Liſt: which Cornice ſhall alſo ſerue for a Capitall vpon the Pillars, aboue the Columnes, and ſhalbe of the ſame bredth that the Columne is aboue.

The height of the Corona, with the two Cimaties, and the Scima, are like the ſecond and third Facie, together with the Cimatie: but the Proiecture of Corona, Cimatie, and Scima, each of them hold as much as the height.

The Columne of Corinthia worke is made by a common rule, conſiſting of 9. parts in height, with Capitals and Baſes: the Capitall whereof, ſhall be as high as the Columne is thicke below, but the Baſe ſhall be of halfe the thickeneſſe of the Columne. Of this halfe, or height of the Baſe, there ſhall be foure euen parts made, whereof the one is for the Plinthus, the other three ſhall be deuided in fiue equall parts, whereof one part ſhall bee for the Thorus aboue, but the Thorus vnder ſhall be a fourth part thicker: ſo that which reſteth ſhall be deuided into 2. euen parts, whereof one part is for the Scotie below, with the Aſtragall, and two Liſts or borders: that Aſtragall ſhall be the ſixt part, and each liſt or border the halfe thereof: but the liſt or border vnder the nethermoſt Thorus, ſhall bee a third part more then the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The Proiecture of the Plinthus ſhall ſtand aboue in another order of Columnes, making them like the Ionica order; but if the place be beneath vpon the ground, then the Proiecture ſhall be like the Dorica order. Alſo, according to the place where the Baſes ſhalbe placed, ſo the workeman muſt adde or diminiſh, as is before ſayd: for as theſe Baſes ſtand beneath the ſight, it will ſtand well; but if it bee placed aboue the ſight, then all the places that are vſed by the other members, with their ſeueral diſtances, ſhall be made grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, then by this rule is preſcribed. And the higher they be ſet, ſo much the leſſe and fayrer ſeeme the members therein the workeman of the Rotonde was well aduiſed, for that hee made the Baſes aboue the firſt ſtory within, with two Scoties, but yet with one Aſtragall alone, in ſtead of two.</hi>

The height of this Capitall ſhall bee like the thickneſſe of the Columne below: the Aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus the ſeuenth part of that height. Of the reſt there ſhalbe thrée parts made: one for the leaues below; the other for the leaues in the middle; and the laſt for the Volutes, as we may call them. But betwéene the Volutes and the middlemoſt leaues, there is a ſpace left to the leſſer leaues, from the which the Volutes grew. The Capitall marked <hi>B.</hi> ſhall bee vnderneath like the Columne aboue: vnder the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacus, there is a Cintha made, the height whereof ſhall be halfe the Abacus: of which Abacus, thrée parts being made, one ſhalbe for the Cimatie with the Liſts, and the reſt for the Plinthus. Vnder the foure corners of the Abacus, the greateſt Volutes are made; and in the middle of the Abacus, there is a flower as great as the Abacus is thicke, vnder the which the leaſt Volutes ſhalbe made; vnder the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt, and alſo vnder the ſmalleſt Volutes, the middle leaues ſhalbe ſet, betwéene the which the leaſt leaues ſhall grow out, and out of them the Volutes ſpring. The middlemoſt, and alſo the vndermoſt leaues, ſhall each be <hi>8.</hi> in number, ſtanding betwéene each other, as the figure <hi>C.</hi> ſheweth. The wideneſſe of the Abacus, from poynt to poynt, ſhalbe two Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meters of the Columnes below: which Diameter ſhalbe placed in a <hi>4.</hi> ſquare, &amp; a Circle drawne with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the foureſquare, which ſhall touch the foure cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners: then, without this great Circle, another foure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſquare being made, and deuided in Diagonall, that is, croſſe-wiſe, thoſe lines will ſhew to be two Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meters in length (as <hi>Vitruuius</hi> teacheth.) But from the line <hi>B.

So I ſay, when the Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traue is made as it ſtandeth by the Ionica, vnder the middlemoſt Facie, there ſhall be an Aſtragall made of the eyght part of the ſame Facie, and vnder the vpper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Facie alſo, one of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> eyght parts of the ſayd Facie wrought with Lead, as you ſée: after that, when the Freeſe is ſet with the Cimatie, and thereto the Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticules with the Cimatie, then you muſt place the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chine aboue it, of ſuch height as the firſt Facie is, the which with the Proiectures and cuttings, ſhall ſhew more then the middlemoſt Facie: aboue the Echine, you muſt ſet the Corona, Cimatie, and Sima, as it is ſayd in the Ionica Order.</p>
                     <p>SOme Romiſh workemen, procéeding with more boldeneſſe, haue not onely placed Echines aboue the Denticules, but alſo made Mutiles and Dentiles to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, in one Cornice, which is much condemned by <hi>Vitruuius</hi> in his fourth Booke, and ſecond Chapter: for that the Dentiles repreſent certaine téeth, by <hi>Vitruuius</hi> called Aſſeri, and the Mogdilions are for the ſupporting of other ends of wood, by the ſayd Author called Cantery: which two kind of beames may not ſtand together in one place; and I, for my part, could neuer endure Dentiles and Mutiles in one Cornice, although Rome aboundeth therein, and diuers places of Italy alſo: but procéeding orderly in this worke, I find a generall rule, that is, that the height of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnes with Baſes and Capitals, ſhalbe deuided in <hi>4.</hi> parts, whereof one is giuen to the Architraue, Fréeſe and Cornice, and ſuch a height agreeth with the Dori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca: the fourth part ſhalbe deuided in <hi>10.</hi> parts: <hi>3.</hi> ſhall be for the Architraue, as aforeſayd, <hi>3.</hi> for the Fréeſe, and <hi>4.</hi> for the Cornice. But of thoſe <hi>4.</hi> there are <hi>9.</hi> parts made, one ſhall bee for the Cimatie aboue the Fréeſe, <hi>2.</hi> for the Echine with the Liſt, <hi>2.</hi> for the Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles with their Cimatie, <hi>2.</hi> for the Corona, and the <hi>2.</hi> laſt parts for the Sima, with her Cimatie, which ſhall be the fourth part of the Sima. The Proiect of all ſhall be as aforeſayd: you may alſo make this Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traue, Fréeſe and Cornice, of the firſt part of the height of the Columne, as <hi>Vitruuius</hi> ſayth in his fift Booke, and ſeuenth Chapter of the Theater.</p>

                     <p>AMong other Antiquities of the Corinthia, which are ſéene in <hi>Italy,</hi> I thinke the Pantheon of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Arch tryumphant, at the Hauen of Ancona, are the fayreſt and beſt to be ſéene: of which Arch; the Capitall hereunder marked <hi>A.</hi> is with great care proportioned after the great: which height is contrary to the writing of <hi>Vitruuius:</hi> neuertheleſſe, it had good correſpondencie; &amp; it may be, that <hi>Vitruuius</hi> meant, that the height of the Capitall ſhould be one Columnes thickeneſſe without the Abacus: but the text herein is falſified, for that I haue not onely found this Capitall, but others more of ſuch proportion. The Columnes hereof are chaneled, as it is ſhewed here: the Pedeſtall with the Baſe vpon it, is a member of the ſame Arch, alſo proportioned in the ſmall: the Cornice hereunto added, was found at <hi>Al foro tranſitorio</hi> in <hi>Rome:</hi> that marked with <hi>A.</hi> is very handſome, for a Corinthian Cornice without Mog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dilions: that marked with <hi>B.</hi> is a little fayrer; but that with <hi>C.</hi> is the vnhandſomeſt, becauſe of the double parts, which haue no good grace from the Corona downewards: and alſo, for that the Corona, vpon ſo much Cornice, hath ſo ſmall Proiecture. The Baſe of the Pedeſtall marked <hi>D.</hi> in my opinion, is very fayre, and alſo the Baſement with <hi>E.</hi> I thinke hath béene a thing that hath continued in ſome building: which things, altogether, men may applie to the order of Corinthia; and in the Ionica I haue ſéene the like. The Architraue <hi>V.</hi> is in <hi>Verona,</hi> in an Arch tryumphant, which Facies ſtandeth contrary to <hi>Vitruuius</hi> writing: yet I haue ſet them here to ſhew ſuch difference.</p>

But for that you cannot ſée the firſt, without ſéeing a part of the ſides, therefore it ſeemeth to ſuch as looke on it, to be broader then in effect it is. And this doore, becauſe it is ſo high, comes in Perpendicular, and is not leſſened as the other aforeſayd: all the other members are proportioned according to the greatneſſe. The Baſe aboue the Gate, is like that of flat Columnes aboue the firſt order, which I haue ſet downe by the Corinthia.</p>

The thickeneſſe of the Columnes ſhall bee a ſixt part of the Pillar. The Niches betwéene the Columnes are <hi>2.</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnes thickeneſſe in bredth: their height is ſomewhat leſſe then <hi>2.</hi> foureſquares. The height of the Pedeſtals of <hi>3.</hi> Columnes thickneſſe. The height of the Arch ſhalbe made of <hi>2.</hi> foureſquares.

The Impoſt which beareth the Arch, ſhalbe of the ſame height, made, in maner, like that of the Theater of <hi>Marcellus,</hi> in the Order of Ionica: which Impoſt ſhall ſerue for a Cornice aboue the doore: but the height of the doore ſhalbe made thus: Vnder the ſayd Cornice, the Supercilie ſhalbe alſo made of the like height; and from thence downewards there ſhalbe <hi>2.</hi> equall parts made to the Stayres; whereof, one ſhalbe the bredth of the light, and likewiſe the Cornice of the doore, as the eyes, ſhall come with the windowes, and the Cimatie of the Pedeſtall ſhall alſo come in like ſort vnder the windowes. The light of the windowes ſhalbe taken Diagonall wiſe: and the Antepagmentum a ſixt part of the light. The particular members of the Pedeſtall, Baſe and Capitals, ſhalbe made, as in the firſt part of this Order it is ſayd.

The height with Baſe and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital of ten parts and an halfe: the Arch, Pilaſter, and impoſt of the halfe Columne: the meaſure of the Impoſt a man may take from the Dorica Chapter, altering the members: the ſame ſhall alſo ſerue for a Cornice aboue the doore, and for ſupporting of the windowes aboue the ſhops: the height of the Arch (for ſometimes vpon occaſion, a man ſhall be forced to haue it ſo low as you ſée) ſhall be of <hi>3.</hi> parts in the bredth, and <hi>5.</hi> in height: and the doore alſo ſhall haue the ſame proportion. The Antepagmentum ſhall be the ſixt part of the light; and if the workeman will make the height of the Arch of double proportion, the doore alſo will be of ſuch proportion: but the Columnes ſhould néed a great ſtone vnderth Baſes, with which things ancient workemen holpe themſelues. The height of the Architraue, Fréeſe, and Cornice are of <hi>2.</hi> Columnes thickeneſſe, as it is ſaid in the firſt part of the rules, or in maner of ſome Antiquities afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhewed.

                     <p>AS I haue at other times ſayd, that the workeman ſhall haue Columnes inow, but yet ſo ſhort, that ſometimes they will not ſerue his turne, vnleſſe the induſtrie and cunning of the workeman bee ſuch, that he can helpe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe there with. The compoſition of this Facie ſhall bee thus, that the wydeneſſe of an Arch ſhall be of double height in bredth: the Pillar ſhall be halfe the ſame wideneſſe before: but that Pillar being made in three parts and an halfe, one part thereof ſhalbe the thickeneſſe of one Columne: The inter-Columne of a halfe Columne: and ſo much alſo the Pilaſters and the Arch hold. The height of the Pedeſtals, without the Plinthus vnder them; ſhalbe as much as the whole bredth of the Pilaſter, the members being deuided, as I haue ſayd of the Pedeſtals of Corinthia. The height of the Columne, with Baſes and Capitals ſhalbe of <hi>11.</hi> parts, and that ſhal not therefore be falſe, for it is ſet faſt on a ſtone, more for ornament, then for vpholding of any waight. The height of the Architraue, Fréeſe, and Cornice ſhall be made of the fourth part of the Columnes, and in Perpendicular the Columnes ſhall beare out all the members without the Corona or Cima, which will goe right through without crookening; for good Antiquities vſed to doe ſo: and <hi>Bramant</hi> alſo, the light of Architecture in our age, made ſuch a houſe in Rome, called <hi>Beluedore.</hi> The wideneſſe of the doore, ſhalbe of foure Columnes thickeneſſe, and twice as high. The Antepagmentum, Supercilie, and Fréeſe, ſhall bee made ſo, that the Cornices, which vphold the Columnes, ſhall ſerue alſo aboue the doore, and alſo ouer the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes. The wideneſſe whereof ſhall bee of thrée Columnes thickeneſſe, and the height of fiue. The ſecond Story ſhall be leſſe then the firſt, the fourth part: but the whole height being deuided in <hi>6.</hi> one ſhall be for the Podium, foure for the ſpaces of the windowes, and the other for the Architraue, Fréeſe and Cornice, deuided in ſuch maner, as you ſhall ſée it in the order of Compoſita. The wideneſſe of the windowes are in Perpendicular to the nethermoſt; and the bredth twice in the height: the reſt of the ornaments, as windowes and Niches, ſhalbe done as in this Ionica Gate is ſhewed, which being wrought with more liuelyneſſe and flouriſhings, will bee a Corinthian worke. The bredth of the Niches with the Pilaſters, ſhalbe in Perpendicular aboue the Columnes, but the wideneſſe thereof, being deuided in <hi>7.</hi> fiue ſhalbe for one Niche, and <hi>2.</hi> for the Pilaſters. The height ſhalbe of <hi>3.</hi> bredths, becauſe they ſtand farre from ſight, whereby they ſhew ſhorter.

But things that are not vſed, if they were made for ſome cauſes, and well proportioned, ſhall not onely bee commended of moſt men, but alſo wondred at. Therefore this building following, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenteth a Temple, ſhall firſt be made of ſtrong ruſticall maner, as you ſée, and of ſuch height as the place and ſituation requireth; but it muſt not be higher then <hi>2.</hi> mens length: On which flat or Pauement, a man ſhall goe vpon, beginning at the ſtep <hi>A.</hi> ſtanding within the entrie, and going vp to <hi>B.</hi> then it ſhall bee flat where the Temple ſhall haue a broad walke, with a leaning round about. The which Temple ſhall bee eleuated from the walking or Paue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, till you come aboue the height of the Podium, or leaning, <hi>3.</hi> ſteps more: and to come to that, you muſt goe vpon the ſtep <hi>C.</hi> to the flat <hi>D.</hi> which ſhalbe the height of the Podium, with another leaning, which ſhalbe higher then the loweſt.

The ſame Stilobato, as is without at the Podium, ſhall alſo bee made vnder the Columne; of which Pedeſtall, the height without the Plinthus, the Baſe ſhalbe <hi>3.</hi> parts. The height of the Columnes, with Baſes and Capitals, ſhalbe of <hi>3.</hi> parts and an halfe.

The widenes of the windowes ſhalbe one part and an halfe; but the height ſhalbe more then <hi>2.</hi> foureſquares, becauſe of the ſayd ſhortening.

On the <hi>4.</hi> corners of the Temple, for the more beautifying, you may make <hi>4.</hi> Piramides: the height whereof (without the Stimen) ſhall be as the eyes are at the beginning of the Faſtigium: and the Scima like the Faſtigium: which Faſtigium ſhalbe made by the like rules, as are ſpoken of before, of the Temple of Dorica.

                     <p>ALthough in theſe our dayes, men make no Arches Tryumphant of Marble or of other ſtones, neuertheleſſe, when any great perſonage entereth into a Towne, they vſe to make Arches tryumphant for to welcome him in, which they ſet in the fayreſt places of the Towne, adorned and painted in moſt curious maner. Therefore, if you will make an Arch after the Corinthia maner, the proportion and meaſure ſhalbe, that the light ſhalbe of two foure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſquares, and one ſixt part: the thickeneſſe of the Columnes ſhall be the <hi>5.</hi> part of the wideneſſe of the doore or light: The height of the Pedeſtals ſhalbe of thrée Columnes thicke: and the height of the Columne ſhalbe of ten parts and an halfe. The Epiſtilie, Sophore, and Cornice, are together the fourth part of the height of the Columne: and ſo from vnder the Arch, to vnder the Architraue, there ſhall hang a role of two Columnes thickeneſſe in height, and the leſſening thereof vnder, ſhalbe drawne vp to the Center of the Arch. Touching the particular members, as the Pedeſtal, Baſe, Capitall, Architraue, Fréeſe, and Cornice, you ſhall obſerue the rule before ſet downe: the bredth of the Arch, with the Pilaſter, ſhalbe halfe a Columne. The inter-Columne muſt be of a Columne and an halfe. The Niches are a Columne broad, and the height thrée, for a ſtanding Image to be placed in them. The height of the ſecond order ſhalbe made thus: the Columne without Pedeſtal, ſhalbe ſet in the vpper part in the Cornice in thrée parts, and one of thoſe parts ſhalbe the height: but of that height there ſhalbe foure parts made: one ſhalbe the Cornice aboue; the diuiding whereof, may be drawne out of the Chapter of Dorica, altering the members. The height of the Baſes ſtand eleuated aboue the Cornice the thickeneſſe of a Columne below; and that is, for that the Proiecture of the Corona darkeneth the reſt of the Baſes netherward. The Cornices ſhall giue out, as you ſee them in the Figure. The height of the Faſtigium ſhall be made by one of the rules ſet downe in the Dorica.

But if you make them in this forme, then the wideneſſe muſt be taken, according to the ſituation of the place: and the Pilaſter ſhall be made of the ſixt part of the wideneſſe; but of the eyght part the worke will be ſéeme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyer: the which Pilaſter or Antepagmentum, together with the Supercilium, ſhall bee deuyded like the Architraue of the Corinthia. This Fréeſe aboue, becauſe it is grauen, ſhalbe made a fourth part greater then the Supercilium. The Cornice, together with the Capitals of the Mutiles, ſhall hold as much as the Supercilium, and the ſame deuided in thrée, as it is ſayd of the Cornice, in the Corinthia.

                     <p>IN a Hall or a great Chamber there is a great Chimney required, proportioned according to the diſtance, the which néedeth a great conueyance; therefore, if a man will make the Modiglions ſufficient for ſuch a bearing out, hee muſt make two places on the ſides: but in ſuch a caſe (I meane) he ſhould make two flat Columnes, and before them round Pillars, not cloſe to the other, in ſuch maner, that betwéene them both the place for the Columne muſt be, and in this maner you ſhall adorne them. As I ſayd in the beginning of this Chapter, the Corinthian maner had her beginning from a mayd, of the Towne of Corinthia: therefore I haue placed a mayd here, in ſtead of a Columne: the height and bredth of the opening, being made according to the place, the height ſhall be deuided in nine parts, and one of thoſe parts ſhall be for the heads of the mayds, and the whole Figure being formed and ſwaddled, as you ſée: then the <hi>flat</hi> Columne or the Pillar ſhall be of the ſame proportion, obſeruing the meaſure before ſet downe.

                        <p>THe Workenan is to haue a great iudgement, becauſe of the diuerſitie of compoſition in Ornaments of buildings, for that there are ſome places in Architecture, of the which there may, almoſt, certayne rules be giuen, for they are no accidents that happen contrary to our opinions, for euery day we ſée ſome Columnes, that with their different poſitions, ſhew different meaſures in themſelues, according to the places where they ſtand. Theſe alterations are ſo made in buildings in <hi>4.</hi> wayes, that is, ſetting the Columnes almoſt in an Inſule, without any companion to helpe it eyther on the ſides or behind. Theſe certaynely beare a great waight, and in their height they goe not aboue the aforeſayd rule: the example hereof is in the firſt Columne marked <hi>A.</hi> but if you place them againſt the wall (though they bee round) by the which being vnderholden and holpen, a man may make another thickneſſe higher aboue the ſame: the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample thereof is in the Columne <hi>B.</hi> Or alſo drawing alone two third parts from the wall, there may yet a thickneſſe or wall go higher then the other, for that you ſée the like in ſome buildings, that riſe to nine thicker &amp; a halfe, and moſt in the Coliſeo of Rome, in the Order of Dorica, as it is ſhewed in the <hi>3.</hi> Columne <hi>C.</hi> but they are more holpen when they haue Pilaſters on the ſides, which bearing all the waight, giue the workeman meanes to make the Columnes more ſéemely, and ſo ſlender, that they may be ſayd rather to be placed there to fill a roome for beautifying, then for ſtrength. You may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo draw a Columne two third parts out of the wall, and on each ſide ſet halfe a Pillar, which will helpe the Columnes ſo well, that you may make another thickneſſe aboue: and in this caſe, the Architraue, Fréeſe and Cornice may beare out vpon the round Columne, yea although it were flat, becauſe the halfe Pillars would hold the Architrane, &amp;c. on the ſides: but vpon one Columne alone, it is vicious to make ſuch worke bearing out, for the other parts beſides ſhould be abando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned without any helpe. This example you ſée in the Columne <hi>D.</hi> But when the Columnes haue any waight to beare vp, without the helpe of another, and ſhall haue fit Intercolumnes, it ſhall not be thought méete to excéede order, yea, although they haue Story vpon Story to beare vp: it is reaſon that they ſhould be made b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>But touching the ſetting of Columne vpon Columne, there are diuers reaſons: The firſt is, that the Proiecture of the Pedeſtals of the Columnes placed aboue, ſhould go no further out, then the thickneſſe of the vndermoſt Columne; and this ſhould be a moſt certayne reaſon: but for that the ſecond Story ſhould leſſen much from the firſt, and would ſerue no more for any other Story, conſidering the great leſſening enſuing, another reaſon, and more to the purpoſe, is this: That the flat of the Pedeſtall ought, at leaſt, to be in Perpendicular with the Columne below, and to ſet the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumne aboue this Pedeſtall, leſſened a fourth part from that which ſtandeth vnder, as well in thickneſſe as in height: ſo this rule agréeth with that of <hi>Vitruuius</hi> in Theatrum: which figure is aboue the Columne <hi>A.</hi> and if you will not leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen the Columne ſo much, then you muſt make the vppermoſt Columne as thicke as the nethermoſt is in the vppermoſt part: but in this caſe, the flat or maſſy part of the Pedeſtall would be broader then the nethermoſt Columne is thicke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low: neuertheleſſe, thoſe of the Theater of <hi>Marcellus</hi> worke that effect. The example hereof is in the Columne <hi>B.</hi> and theſe thrée reaſons are probable inough. But the ancient Romanes, in the great Edifice of the Coliſeo, made the Columne Ionica, Corinthia and Compoſita all of one thickneſſe; and the Dorica, vnder all the other, they made thicker, about the twentieth part. And this (in my opinion) they did by good aduice: for if they had leſſened all the Columnes the fourth part, one aboue the other, the laſt, in ſo great a building, by reaſon of the great diſtance, would haue ſhewed very ſmall, which we now ſée to be of good correſpondence, by reaſon of the height. The ſhewing of this is in the Columne <hi>C.</hi> And as the Columne aboue the Columne <hi>D.</hi> is leſſe then that which ſtandeth loweſt one fourth part: for that, if a man hath a reaſonable houſe to make of <hi>3.</hi> Stories, ſo I would not thinke it amiſſe, that a man ſhould leſſen euery Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie the fourth part, according to <hi>Vitruuius</hi> aduice: but if the building be high, then you were better obſerue the Order of the Coliſeo, that the Stories Dorica, Ionica and Corinthia, may each bee about one height, but the Story aboue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth in height about the fift part: and this is ſo (as I haue ſayd) becauſe of the great diſtances which part, by meanes of the great diſtance, ſéemes to be of the height that the reſt are: and although that the ſhewing of theſe Columnes is Doricall, yet it is ſo in all ſorts of Columnes.</p>

                        <p>HAuing ſpoken of ſo many and diuers Ornaments of ſtones, it is requiſite, that I ſhould alſo ſhew how they are to be placed in worke; and ſpecially, when a man is to mixe hard ſtones &amp; bricks together, which requireth great diligence and Arte: for that bricks are like fleſh in a péece of worke, and hard ſtones like the bones to knit and hold them together: which two things, if they be not well and faſtly bound together, they will, in time, decay: and therefore the foundation being made in ſuch maner as the place affordeth, it is requiſite, that the prouident workeman ſhould make ready, all the hard ſtones, and alſo the bricks, with the reſt of the ſtuffe belonging thereunto, and ſo ſhould come to lay and ioyne the hard ſtones and the bricks together, all at one time: and it is requiſite, that the hard ſtones ſhould be ſet ſo farre with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the wall, that although there were no morter to hold them together, yet they ſhould, of themſelues, ſtand faſt in the wall: which doing, the worke will be ſtrong and continue hard. The example hereof is ſéene in the other ſide, by the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure <hi>A.</hi> where it is alſo ſhewed, how a man may make places breſt high, without feare. And if you haue Pedeſtals with Columnes to ſet vpon them, where hard and ſoft ſtones are mixed together, if the hard ſtones be not well ioyned with the ſoft, as you ſée in the figure <hi>B.</hi> the worke will not continue long. And if the Columnes be of diuers péeces, ſome of them (that is the leaſt) ſhall goe déepe into the wall, to hold the other the faſter. But if the Columnes bee of one péece, them they would ſtand, at leaſt, a third part within the wall; but the Baſes and Capitals muſt enter much more into the wall, and aboue all the Corona and other Cornices, which beare farre out from the wall. The innermoſt part that is vnwrought, muſt counteruayle that which is without, that it may beare it ſelfe: but if at the ſame time a man will make any worke or Facie vpon the ſtones, then it is requiſite, that the workeman, before he begins to lay any worke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue the ground, ſhould make ready all his ſtones, together with the other ſtuffe belonging thereunto: and ſo laying and knitting the ſtones with the bricks together, I ſay, that he ſhall doe well to ſet ſome of the ſtones ſo déepe into the wall, that they may hold the other péeces together by force, ioyning well in, as you ſée it in the figure <hi>C.</hi> that in time they may not ryue and breake aſunder one from the other. But that the wall, made of bricke, ſhould not ſinke, and ſinking, ſhould breake the thinneſt parts, by reaſon of the waight aboue, it is neceſſary to haue bricke well burnt, and morter well tempered, &amp; betwéene the ſtones little morter, &amp; wel layd and ioyned one vpon the other: And aboue all, ſuch worke would not be made by any force, nor waight vpon waight, to be packt in haſte, but you muſt let it reſt ſomewhat from lay to lay: for if a man wil worke in haſte, and ſet great waight vpon it, it is moſt certayne, the wall will ſinke, and the ſtones being not able to beare ſhe waight, will breake; but if it be made with leyſer, then the ſtuffe will be as it ſhould be: ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe, I would alwayes more commend the worke that is wholy bound in the wall, then that which is ioyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether or couered; and ſpecially, in my opinion, men ſhould not make them in walles that ſtand outward, for that the houſes which haue béene made ſo in former time, by ancient workemen, and were couered ouer with Marble and other fine ſtones, are now ſéene all without ſtones before, and nothing but the wall of bricke, that ſtood behind them, ſtandeth ſtill: but thoſe buildings, where the hard ſtones are bound and ioyned into, and with the bricks, are yet ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: neuertheleſſe, if you will make ſuch worke ſimple, I thinke this the ſureſt way, although ſome workemen, in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers places of <hi>Italy,</hi> haue made ſome building, with ſimple walles, leauing places in them for hard ſtones to be put in, and after, at another time, haue put in ſuch Ornaments: neuertheleſſe, for that ſuch things are not well faſtened in the wall, but in a maner hackt, you may in many places ſée the péeces falne, and euery day more and more decay.</p>

Therefore if they haue a Forefront or Facie of a houſe to paynt, it is certayne, there is no open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to be left, where ayre or lantſhap is to be made, for thoſe breake the building; and of a thing that is maſſy and cloſe, they tranſforme it into an open weake forme, like a ruinous and vnperfit building. Alſo there ſhould be no perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nages nor beaſts coloured, vnleſſe it were to trim and decke doores, wherein there are mens perſonages: but if the owner of the houſe, or the Paynter, deſire colours, that the worke may not be broken nor ſpoyled, a man may couer a hackled wall ouer with cloth, and therein paynt what he will: and alſo, after the maner of tryumphs, a man may hang on the wall Garlands, and ſtrings of Leaues, and Fruits, Flowers, &amp;c. and alſo Shields, Trophees, and ſuch things as are to be ſtirred: but if you will paynt the walles with firme matter, then you may fayne things of marble or other ſtones, cutting therein what you will: you may alſo beautifie ſome figures in Niches, with metall, and ſo the worke will remayne firme, &amp; worthy commendation of all thoſe that know good worke from bad. And the Author rehearſeth di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers excellent workemen, whome (for breuitie ſake) I will omit, that onely vſed to paynt nothing elſe but white and blacke in houſes, and yet ſo excellently well, that it made men wonder to behold them. A man may alſo, with good reaſon, make and ſet forth certayne openings in walles of lodgings, round about the Courts, and make ayre, lantſhaps, houſes, figures, beaſts, and ſuch like things, as hee will in colours. Alſo, if a man hath Chambers, Halles, or other places, about the ground within, to paynt and ſet forth, then a Paynter, in maner of Architecture, may make open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings to ſee through them, as the place is: for aboue the ſight a man muſt make nothing but ayre or ſkyes, roofes, high hilles, and the vpper part of houſes: and if you place figures alſo aboue the ſight, a man muſt ſee vnder them, and not the ground whereon they ſtand. And if the Paynter will make a Hall or any other, or further roome perſpectiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he may, ouer the going in, with order of Architecture, make it to ſhew further then in effect it is. And this, <hi>Baltha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar</hi> (a man excellently well learned in Architecture) did, in beautifying the Hall of <hi>Auguſtin Guyſe,</hi> a Marchant of Rome, where, in that fort he ſet out ſome Columnes, and other Architecture to that purpoſe: ſo that <hi>Peter Aretin,</hi> a man alſo ſkilfull in Paynting and in Poeſie, ſayd, that there had not beene a perfiter Paynter then he in that houſe, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though there is worke alſo in it of <hi>Raphaels</hi> owne doing. And when the walles are paynted, and if you will haue the roofe alſo done, then follow the ſteps of Antiquitie, making things that are called Grootes, which, for that you may make them as you will, ſhew well therein, as Leaues, Flowers, Beaſts, Birds, and other mixed matter. If a man maketh any clothes or apparell of figures, or which are made faſt on them, therein a man may doe as he will. But if a Payn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter will make any figures according to the life, in a roofe of a houſe, then he muſt be very ſkilfull, and much exerciſed in Perſpectiue worke, and very iudicious to chuſe ſuch things as are fitteſt for the place, and rather heauenly flying things, then carthly things, with ſuch Arte, that he muſt ſhorten the figures ſo (although they bee monſtrous) that when men ſtand a conuenient diſtance off from them, they may reſemble the life. Which thing is excellently well made in <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

Therefore the workeman, that ought not to be vnſkilfull in Perſpectiue worke, ſhould not indure, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Surueyor ouer all the workemen in the building, that any thing ſhould bee made therein, without his counſell and aduice.</p>

And which is more, I would ſay, that each place ſhould be ſtuffed and ſuted within, with things ſitting to that which it ſheweth outward. I ſay then, If the Roofe be high, then the deuiſions to be wide of ſpace, and riſing or bearing out well: and if a man will beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie it with Paynting, it muſt bee well done, and conformably paynted, according to the greatneſſe and diſtance thereof. It ought alſo to be made of light and browne colours: and in the middle of the field you muſt ſet a gylt Roſe: but if a man will colour it, then the field muſt be blue, as piercing, but the Roſes muſt be bound with ſome works or branches, that they may not ſeeme to hang in the ayre: and the Cornices which cloſe vp the foureſquare or other fields, muſt bee well gylt, or beautifyed with the ſame colour: but if ſo bee the Roofe is not high inough, then you muſt make the worke thinner and ſmaller, as alſo the paynting: and that you may vnderſtand it, I haue ſet two figures to ſhew you, which, notwithſtanding, are all one: the one of bare wood, the other paynted, as I ſayd before. And this Order I obſerued in the Roofe of the great Librarie in the Palace of <hi>Venice,</hi> in the time of the Prince <hi>Andreagriti,</hi> becauſe the Roofe was lower then it ſhould be, in reſpect of the wideneſſe and length of the Hall, and I made it of thinne worke, for the reaſon aforeſayd.</p>

The Diameter of this ground ſhall be as long as high, according to the Figure of the Circle, that is, of 60. foote. The thickneſſe of the wall ſhall be the fourth part of the Diameter, that is, 15. foote, that a man may eaſily make the Chappels within it: which Chappels ſhall be 12. footbroad. The Niches betweene the Pillars ſhall bee foure foote broad: the other in the Entrie, and of the three Chappels, ſhall be ſixe foote and a halfe broad: and to ſpare charges of ſtone and lime, the great Niches ſhall be made without the Chappell: the bredth whereof ſhall bee 15. foote. This Chappell is eleuated from the earth at leaſt fiue ſteps; and if it were higher, it were not amiſſe: for the earth in time riſeth, ſo that men goe downeward into many old Temples and Churches, whereunto, in former time they aſcended vpwards: but this Stayre would alwayes be vneuen, according to <hi>Vitrunius</hi> writing, ſpeaking of Temples, where he ſayth: that as a man with his right foote begins to clyme vp, he may, with the ſayd right foote, ſtep vpon the pauement of the Temple. Touching the foundation, a man cannot ſayle, if hee maketh it deepe and broad inough: but the leaſt bredth that a man can lay, is this: that a man ſhould from the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ameter of the thickeneſſe of the wall, make a perfit foureſquare, and the Diagonus of this foureſquare ſhall be the bredth of the foundation vnder the wall. And ſo, I thinke, <hi>Vitrunius</hi> writeth, where he ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of foundations. But touching the Stofes of foundations, in faſt or hard ground, and alſo in watry ground, I neede not ſhew it here, becauſe euery man knowes it.</p>

The hole aboue the Roofe, ſhalbe the ſeuenth part of the wideneſſe of the Diameter of the Temple: aboue, vpon that hole, there may bee a Lanthorne made, ſtopt with glaſſe, or it may be left open, whereat there will come in light inough to the middle of the Temple, for that the Chappels haue light inough at their windowes: the top of this Temple will beſt bee couered with Lead: the Cornice without, ſhall ſtand like that within, but much greater of members, becauſe it ſtandeth in the weather.

The greateſt going through, or walke in the middle of the Church, is <hi>30.</hi> foot wide: the thrée Chappels of halfe Circles, beſides the <hi>2.</hi> ſmalleſt walkes, are <hi>25.</hi> foot wide, and ſhall ſtand ſomewhat without the wall.

The great and the ſmall doores alſo ſhalbe beautified with ſome workes, as you ſée in this Figure, taking the particular meaſures out of the Dorica order, in my fourth Booke. The eleuation or ryſing vp in the middle, ſhall to the vpper part of the Cornice be <hi>25.</hi> foot; and the Cornice thereof ſhall be the fourth part leſſe then the other Cornice vnder it, made after the forme of the Dorica Chapter. The Frontiſpicie is fifteene foot high, aboue it ſtands the couer or the Kettle, with this Lanthorne vpon it, the meaſure whereof, a man may take out of that before. Below, vpon the firſt Cornice, beſides the middlemoſt bearing vp, you ſhall make a Baſement of fiue foot high; aboue that Baſement, you muſt place the two Towers, which are <hi>42.</hi> foot and an halfe high, making the Cornice the fourth part leſſe then the other, formed after the Dorica Chapter. The third order ſhall be the fourth part leſſe then the ſecond, and the Cornice thereafter: the fourth order ſhall alſo be a fourth part leſſe then the third, and the Cornice there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.

                        <p>THe Figure following ſheweth the aforeſayd Temple within, whereof the length and bredth is ſet downe in the ground: but here I will ſpeake of the height. The Cornice ſhall ſtand high, &amp; be as great as the vttermoſt, that is, the ſixt part of <hi>62.</hi> foot, but ſhalbe made after the Ionica maner. The flat Pillars ſhal alſo be Ionica: the Impoſt which beareth the Arches, ſhal alſo be Ionica; whoſe forme, touching the meaſures, you ſhal find them all together orderly in my fourth Booke: all the Chappels ſhall haue their light of themſelues, as you ſée. Aboue the Chappels, the Roofe ſhalbe broken like a Moone, therein to make an ouall round hole, that it may yéeld more light: and that the Tribune may haue more light then from the Lanthorne, you ſhall, from the couer vpwards, make a Fréeſe with a Liſt, and therein alſo make round holes for light. This ſmall cloſed figure, ſtanding alone, aboue the Temple, ſheweth one of the ſide doores of the Temple, in the croſſe-worke, whereof the doore is <hi>10.</hi> foot wyde, and <hi>20.</hi> high. The Architraue, Freeſe and Cornice, vnder the couer or Roofe, although the Pillars are broken after another maner, with the Liſt of the Portall, ſhall neuertheleſſe agrée with the Cornicement that goeth round about the Temple. And although it is not here ſhewed how the wydeſt ſpace of the walke betweene the Pilaſters and the roofe is, and how that the ſmalleſt walke is not ſo high roofed, nor the forme of the ſmall Kettles and Veſtries are not ſhewed, yet the workeman may imagine it by the ground: for he that vndertaketh ſuch a piece of worke, muſt not be vnſkilfull.</p>

                        <p>THis Temple following is <hi>30.</hi> foote wide in the middle. The croſſe worke, and alſo the Tribune, together with the high Quier, ſhall each of them contayne <hi>30.</hi> foot. The Arches which beare the Tribune, ſhalbe <hi>24.</hi> foote wide. The Pillars on the ſides, where the Niches ſtand, ſhalbe <hi>5.</hi> foote broad. Each ſide of the Croſſe worke is <hi>38.</hi> foot long, and ſhall each of them haue a Doore. The part before the high Quier, towards the Altar, is <hi>4.</hi> ſquare. The Pilaſters with the Niches, before the halfe Circle of the high Altar, are <hi>5.</hi> foote broad, and ſtand from other <hi>24.</hi> foot. The Niche or halfe Circle is <hi>23.</hi> foote wide. In the <hi>2.</hi> corners on the ſides of the high Quier, there are <hi>2.</hi> Veſtries, which ſhalbe <hi>17.</hi> foote wide in <hi>4.</hi> ſquare. From the Tribune to the principall going in, there ſhall ſtand <hi>5.</hi> Chappels on eyther ſide, which ſhalbe <hi>15.</hi> foote within <hi>4.</hi> ſquare. The walles betwéene both ſhall bee <hi>4.</hi> foote thicke. The win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes ſhalbe <hi>6.</hi> foote wide, and there Altars ſhall ſtand. The wall at the Doores ſhall bee <hi>4.</hi> foote thicke, and on the ſides where the Niches ſtand, <hi>5.</hi> foot. Here before there ſhall come a Gallery of <hi>14.</hi> foote broad, and of <hi>68.</hi> foote long. The Niches ſhalbe <hi>8.</hi> foote broad. On the ſides of this Portall the Towers ſhall ſtand, and ſhall ſtand as broad out at the ſides, as the croſſe worke. The Diameter within the Towers is <hi>18.</hi> foote: and although they be <hi>8.</hi> ſquare, they may alſo be made <hi>4.</hi> ſquare. The winding Stayres ſtand in the thickeneſſe of the wall.</p>

The Portall aboue ſhalbe flat without roofe, to take no light away in the Temple. From the Pauement, to the top of the Cornice which goeth round about the Temple, it ſhalbe <hi>47.</hi> foote high.

                        <p>The Figure aboue the cloſed Temple, marked with <hi>A.</hi> ſheweth the inner part of the <hi>5.</hi> Chappels.

The other figure aboue that aforeſayd, marked <hi>B.</hi> ſheweth the Tribune, the Quier and the ſides of the croſſe worke, with the open and the blynd Doores. Through the one ſide (which was purpoſely broken) you may ſée the Veſtryes within. The Cornice vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Arches, which beare the Kettle, is like the other Cornice which goeth round about the Temple. The Cornice which is aboue the Arch, and comes vnder the Kettle, ſhalbe baſtard. The Lanthorne muſt bee made according to the other Lanthornes afore ſhewed. The other part marked <hi>C.</hi> is one of the Doores on the ſides, and is in that maner co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered round. The Doore is <hi>9.</hi> foote wide, and <hi>18.</hi> foote high.</p>

                        <p>ALthough that in the Netherlands there are very fayre Temples made, as the maner in theſe dayes is, not onely with three Iles or walkes in the body, but alſo fiue: my meaning is not to write of ſuch great Temples, for that each Towne hath her chiefe Church: but theſe are onely to make ſuch Churches in places, where, by chance, the Churches are decayed, becauſe in theſe dayes, men could hardly make them vp againe in great forme; and to this end I ſet this laſt figure here, which is playner then the other. It ſhalbe <hi>36.</hi> foot wyde, and <hi>54.</hi> foot long. At each end before and behind, there ſhall ſtand halfe a Circle of <hi>24.</hi> foot in Diameter. This halfe Circle where the high Altar ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, hath two windowes, each <hi>6.</hi> foot wyde. The doore to enter into the Temple, ſhalbe <hi>8.</hi> foot wyde.

The <hi>4.</hi> Niches within the body, are beautified with round Columnes ſtanding in the wall. Without the Temple there is a Portall of <hi>10.</hi> foot broad, and <hi>52.</hi> foot long. The high Pilaſters ſhalbe <hi>6.</hi> foot broad, as counterforts,; and the other ſhalbe thrée foot broad.
